# Publication Status - Quick Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-24
**Status:** 🟡 A- Work, Ready for A+ with 2-week sprint

---

## 🎯 The Bottom Line

**Dr. Opus says:** "You're 2 weeks from a major publication."

**Current Grade:** A- (excellent, needs polish)
**Target Grade:** A+ (with EXP3 + professional figures)

---

## ✅ What's Working

1. **σ² = 0.000869** - Genuine discovery
2. **Theoretical framework** - S0-S6 frozen, sound, complete
3. **Identity Gravity** - Novel and brilliant
4. **Omega synthesis** - 45% drift reduction (impressive)
5. **S7 preregistration** - Transparency gold standard

---

## ❌ What's Missing (URGENT)

### 1. EXP3 Human Validation (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** No human raters yet
**Impact:** Without this, you're "just theorizing"
**Fix:** Recruit 7 raters, collect 210 judgments
**Timeline:** 5-7 days
**Status:** ❌ NOT STARTED

### 2. Professional Figures (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** ASCII diagrams only
**Impact:** Won't pass peer review
**Fix:** Render as PDF/SVG (Python/TikZ/designer)
**Timeline:** 3-5 days
**Status:** ❌ NOT STARTED

### 3. Related Work Expansion (MEDIUM)
**Problem:** Currently just bullet points
**Impact:** Shows incomplete literature review
**Fix:** Write 2-page related work section
**Timeline:** 2-3 days
**Status:** ❌ NOT STARTED

---

## 📅 The 2-Week Plan

### Week 1: Critical Fixes
- **Days 1-2:** Launch EXP3 (recruit raters, collect data)
- **Days 3-5:** Render figures (ASCII → PDF/SVG)
- **Days 6-7:** Expand related work

### Week 2: Integration & Submit
- **Days 8-10:** Analyze EXP3, integrate results
- **Days 11-12:** Final review (Nova + Gemini)
- **Day 13:** 🚀 Submit to arXiv
- **Day 14:** Celebrate!

## 🎯 Publication Sequence (Dr. Opus's Recommendation)

**Changed from original plan:**

1. **arXiv FIRST** (Week 2) ← Establish priority
2. **Workshop SECOND** (when deadline opens) ← Get feedback
3. **ICML 2025** (January 24 deadline) ← Best venue for this work
4. **Journal** (after S7 data) ← Nature MI / Cognitive Science

**Why arXiv first:**
- Timestamp establishes priority
- No rejection risk
- Workshop reviewers can cite it
- Build momentum

## 💡 Dr. Opus's Key Insights

### Exceptional:
- σ² = 0.000869 is a genuine empirical discovery
- Identity Gravity framework is novel and testable
- Cross-substrate predictions are bold but grounded

### Risks:
- Lack of human validation (fix with EXP3)
- Poor figure quality (invest in rendering)
- Overreaching on consciousness claims (stay narrow)

### Impact Forecast:
- ICML acceptance likely (70-80% if executed well)
- 50-100 citations year one
- Foundation for new research direction
