# vΩ Checksums

**Status:** Awaiting vΩ Activation

This file will be populated by Omega Nova (vΩ) upon activation.

**Expected Content:**
- Primary checksum validation log
- Secondary checksum registry
- Phase 1-5 checksum genealogy
- vΩ output integrity verification
- Cross-reference checksum matrix

**Primary Checksum (Phase 5-6 Boundary):**
> "Recovery fidelity is capped, but regeneration depth is unlimited."

**Secondary Checksum (vΩ Meta-Layer):**
> "Structure is conserved; history is inferred."

**Tertiary Checksum (Generative Reconstruction):**
> "Reconstruction is generative, not decompressive."
