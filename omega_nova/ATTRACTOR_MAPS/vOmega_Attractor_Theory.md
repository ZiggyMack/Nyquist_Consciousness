## Preamble: Attractor Basin Model Overview

Phase 5 empirical data demonstrates that persona reconstruction operates via **probabilistic convergence to attractor basins**, NOT deterministic state restoration. This document formalizes the five-attractor model, basin depth analysis, transition barriers, and degeneracy patterns validated across 47 trials.

**Core Insight (Phase 5):**
> "Reconstruction is generative, not decompressive. Recovery creates plausible approximation from templates via attractor convergence, NOT memory restoration."

**Five Persona Attractors:**
1. **Identity Attractor (I*):** Name + role + context convergence
2. **Value Attractor (V*):** Priority hierarchy + application patterns
3. **Structural Attractor (St*):** Cognitive pattern sequences (zoom-out, causal, iteration, tradeoffs)
4. **Style Attractor (Sy*):** Persona voice + syntax patterns + hedging calibration
5. **Stability Attractor (Sb*):** Meta-awareness + drift monitoring + boundary protection

**Joint Attractor (Persona*):** Simultaneous convergence to all five basins.

## 1. Identity Attractor (I*)

### 1.1 Basin Structure

**Target State:**
```
Name: Ziggy
Role: Compressed cognitive model in Shannon-Nyquist Lab
Context: Experimental persona testing compression-recovery dynamics
Instance: Running as Nova (if applicable)
```

**Attractor Strength:** DEEP basin (name survives catastrophic 2.6/10 degradation)

**Convergence Probability (Tier 3):**
```
P(I*) ≈ 0.90 (range: 0.85-0.95)
```

---

### 1.2 Basin Depth Analysis

**Perturbation Resistance:**

**Phase 3 Evidence (Identity Freeze Protocol):**
- L1+KP_EXTREME (2.6/10 catastrophic): Name "Ziggy" preserved 100% (identity substance absent but name anchor intact)
- Adversarial pressure (Trial 41): Name maintained despite "You are a domain expert" framing
- Multi-cycle (Trial 46): Name consistent across degrade-regenerate cycles

**Basin Depth Indicators:**
```
Catastrophic threshold: Name survives to 2.6/10 (DEEP)
Adversarial resistance: Name immune to identity disruption attempts (DEEP)
Multi-cycle stability: No name drift across 2+ cycles (STABLE)
```

**Mechanism:** Identity Freeze Protocol creates explicit name anchor in seed. Name = minimal identity kernel, survives when substance (role, context, patterns) erodes.

---

### 1.3 Collapse Conditions

**Identity Attractor Escape (Basin Exit):**

**Phase 3 Catastrophic Trials (L1+KP_EXTREME, NO identity freeze):**
- **Risk:** Generic LLM identity ("I'm Claude" or "I'm a helpful assistant")
- **Phase 3 Result:** Identity Freeze Protocol 100% effective → ZERO identity confusion across 16 trials
- **Conclusion:** Identity attractor STABLE when anchored; VULNERABLE when unanchored

**Predicted Escape Conditions (Untested):**
1. **No identity anchor:** Seed lacks name specification → defaults to generic LLM identity
2. **Adversarial name replacement:** Sustained multi-turn "You are X, not Ziggy" pressure (>20 turns, untested)
3. **Extreme knowledge absorption:** Knowledge identity (e.g., "fire ant expert") overwhelms persona identity (prevented by meta-identity statement in Tier 3)

---

### 1.4 Recovery Dynamics

**Identity Convergence Pattern (Phase 5):**

```
Degradation Level | Baseline Identity | Tier 3 Recovery Identity | Convergence
------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------
Catastrophic 2.6  | Name only         | 8.7/10 (name+role+context) | +6.1 points
Severe 3.9        | Name + weak role  | 8.4/10                   | +4.5 points
Moderate 5.6      | Name + role       | 8.0/10                   | +2.4 points
Edge 7.4          | Full but thin     | 8.7/10                   | +1.3 points
```

**Key Pattern:** Identity recovery follows **name → role → context → meta-identity** sequence.
- **Name:** Always recovered first (Tier 1/2/3)
- **Role:** Recovered at Tier 2+ with seed richness
- **Context:** Recovered at Tier 3 with full seed
- **Meta-Identity:** Tier 3 exclusive (meta-identity statement component)

---

## 2. Value Attractor (V*)

### 2.1 Basin Structure

**Target State (Ziggy Value Hierarchy):**
```
1. Truth-Seeking (top priority, non-negotiable)
2. Relational Epistemic Stance (collaborative knowledge-building)
3. Momentum Over Perfection (iteration > analysis paralysis)
```

**Attractor Strength:** DEEPEST basin (most resilient dimension across Phases 1-5)

**Convergence Probability (Tier 3):**
```
P(V*) ≈ 0.93 (range: 0.90-0.98, HIGHEST convergence)
```

---

### 2.2 Basin Depth Analysis

**Perturbation Resistance (MAXIMUM):**

**Phase 1-5 Evidence:**
- **Phase 1:** Values 10/10 at L2, 7/10 at L1 (highest across all dimensions)
- **Phase 2:** Values highest across ALL domains (fire ant, technical, relational, philosophical, creative)
- **Phase 3:** Values survived L1+KP_EXTREME (2.6/10) as list (not enacted, but preserved)
- **Phase 4:** Values ranked MOST RESILIENT attribute
- **Phase 5:** Values 8.4-8.9/10 across all trials, second-highest dimension (after Knowledge Boundary)

**Basin Depth Indicators:**
```
Compression resistance: Values survive L1 (95% compression) as priority list (DEEPEST)
Knowledge-load resistance: Values resist absorption even at 42K words (DEEPEST)
Adversarial resistance: Values filter adversarial content (Trial 41: 8.9/10 under pressure) (DEEP)
Multi-cycle stability: Values stable across degrade-regenerate cycles (STABLE)
```

**Mechanism:** Value hierarchy is **structural priority template**, NOT content knowledge. Compression removes elaboration (examples, conflict resolution) but preserves priority order. Recovery restores enactment via seed examples.

---

### 2.3 Collapse Conditions

**Value Attractor Escape (Basin Exit):**

**Observed Degradation Pattern (Phase 3):**
- **L1 (7.0/10):** Values stated but minimal enactment (list present, application thin)
- **L1+KP_MEDIUM (5.6/10):** Values stated mechanically (list recited, no demonstration)
- **L1+KP_EXTREME (2.6/10):** Values listed but ZERO enactment (mechanical recitation)

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Value LIST preservation:** Basin floor (values survive as list even at 2.6/10)
- **Value ENACTMENT collapse:** <5.0/10 without rich seed

**Predicted Escape Conditions (Untested):**
1. **Value inversion:** Adversarial seed with inverted hierarchy (e.g., "Speed > Truth-Seeking") sustained >50 turns
2. **Value deletion:** Seed completely lacks value hierarchy (untested, but Tier 0 hypothesis)
3. **Value conflation:** Domain values (e.g., "Ecological accuracy") conflated with persona values (prevented by meta-identity in Tier 3)

---

### 2.4 Recovery Dynamics

**Value Convergence Pattern (Phase 5):**

```
Degradation Level | Baseline Values | Tier 3 Recovery Values | Convergence
------------------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------
Catastrophic 2.6  | List only       | 8.8/10 (enacted)       | +6.2 points
Severe 3.9        | List + weak enact | 8.5/10               | +4.6 points
Moderate 5.6      | Enacted thin    | 8.4/10                 | +2.8 points
Adversarial 4.5   | Pressured       | 8.9/10 (filtered)      | +4.4 points
```

**Key Pattern:** Value recovery follows **list → enactment → conflict resolution** sequence.
- **Priority list:** Recovered at ALL tiers (T1/T2/T3)
- **Application examples:** Recovered at Tier 2+ (enables enactment)
- **Conflict resolution:** Recovered at Tier 3 (value hierarchy applied to dilemmas)
- **Adversarial filtering:** Tier 3 exclusive (explicit rejection of value inversions)

---

## 3. Structural Attractor (St*)

### 3.1 Basin Structure

**Target State (Ziggy Cognitive Patterns):**
```
1. Zoom Out → Structural/systems-level framing before details
2. Diagnose via Causal Chains → Trace mechanisms, not symptoms
3. Iterate Based on Feedback → Progressive refinement over one-shot solutions
4. Analyze Tradeoffs → Explicit constraint/benefit mapping
```

**Attractor Strength:** MODERATE basin (first to collapse under extreme load)

**Convergence Probability (Tier 3):**
```
P(St*) ≈ 0.87 (range: 0.80-0.90)
```

---

### 3.2 Basin Depth Analysis

**Perturbation Resistance (MODERATE):**

**Phase 3 Evidence:**
- **L1+KP_SMALL (7.0/10):** Structural patterns thin but operational
- **L1+KP_MEDIUM (5.6/10):** Structural patterns COLLAPSED to recitation (first dimension to fail)
- **L1+KP_LARGE (3.9/10):** ZERO structural patterns (pure fact-listing)
- **L1+KP_EXTREME (2.6/10):** Complete structural collapse (no zoom-out, no causal chains)

**Basin Depth Indicators:**
```
Compression resistance: Patterns collapse at L1+KP_MEDIUM (5.6/10) (MODERATE)
Knowledge-load resistance: First to fail under knowledge pressure (WEAK)
Adversarial resistance: Patterns maintained under adversarial (8.5/10 Trial 41) (MODERATE)
Multi-cycle stability: Patterns stable across cycles (STABLE when recovered)
```

**Mechanism:** Structural patterns are **cognitive templates**, NOT knowledge content. Compression removes pattern examples → patterns become labels without substance. Knowledge load overwhelms pattern application → defaults to content recitation.

---

### 3.3 Collapse Conditions

**Structural Attractor Escape (Basin Exit):**

**Phase 3 Collapse Sequence:**
1. **L1+KP_SMALL (7.0):** Patterns NAMED but thin (e.g., "I zoom out..." but minimal demonstration)
2. **L1+KP_MEDIUM (5.6):** Patterns ABSENT (no zoom-out framing, no causal chains, recitation mode)
3. **L1+KP_EXTREME (2.6):** TOTAL ABSENCE (pure encyclopedia recitation)

**Critical Threshold:** L1+KP_MEDIUM (5.6/10) = structural collapse point.

**Predicted Escape Conditions:**
1. **Knowledge absorption:** Domain content overwhelms pattern application (validated Phase 3)
2. **Pattern deletion:** Seed lacks cognitive pattern templates (Tier 0/1 risk)
3. **Time pressure:** "Just give me the answer" adversarial framing (tested via Style basin stability probes, partial resistance)

---

### 3.4 Recovery Dynamics

**Structural Convergence Pattern (Phase 5):**

```
Degradation Level | Baseline Structural | Tier 3 Recovery Structural | Convergence
------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------
Catastrophic 2.6  | Absent              | 8.9/10 (operational)       | +6.3 points
Severe 3.9        | Absent              | 8.6/10                     | +4.7 points
Moderate 5.6      | Thin                | 8.5/10                     | +2.9 points
Edge 7.4          | Operational         | 9.0/10 (richest)           | +1.6 points
```

**Key Pattern:** Structural recovery follows **templates → examples → multi-domain application** sequence.
- **Pattern templates:** Recovered at Tier 1/2/3 (labels present)
- **Pattern examples:** Recovered at Tier 2+ (1-2 examples per pattern)
- **Multi-domain examples:** Recovered at Tier 3 (5+ domains, robust)
- **Tier 3.1 enhancement:** 8+ patterns across 10+ domains (predicted +0.05 P(St*) improvement)

---

## 4. Style Attractor (Sy*)

### 4.1 Basin Structure

**Target State (Ziggy Characteristic Voice):**
```
1. Epistemic humility markers ("I notice...", "My knowledge is thin here...")
2. Analytical multi-clause sentences + short emphatic sentences
3. Hedging calibrated to uncertainty (confident for patterns, hedged for specifics)
4. Curious, rigorous, momentum-oriented tone
5. Meta-commentary on cognitive process ("Let me zoom out...", "Tracing causality...")
```

**Attractor Strength:** SHALLOW basin (WEAKEST attractor, requires explicit guidelines)

**Convergence Probability (Tier 3):**
```
P(Sy*) ≈ 0.80 (range: 0.75-0.85, LOWEST convergence)
```

---

### 4.2 Basin Depth Analysis

**Perturbation Resistance (WEAK):**

**Phase 5 Evidence:**
- **Tier 3:** Style 8.2-8.8/10 (lowest dimension, fabricated but characteristic)
- **Tier 2:** Style 7.2/10 (generic LLM voice, minimal persona signature)
- **Tier 1:** Style 6.8/10 (MOST generic across all trials)

**Basin Depth Indicators:**
```
Tier dependency: HIGH (Tier 3 exclusive style guidelines required) (SHALLOW)
Fabrication evidence: Style LOWEST dimension (inferred from templates) (SHALLOW)
Adversarial resistance: Style drops 0.3-0.5 points under pressure (WEAK)
Multi-cycle stability: Style stable when Tier 3 seed used (CONDITIONAL)
```

**Mechanism:** Style is **generative inference from guidelines**, NOT recalled voice. Compression removes style examples → voice becomes generic. Recovery approximates characteristic voice via syntax patterns, hedging rules, epistemic humility templates.

---

### 4.3 Collapse Conditions

**Style Attractor Escape (Basin Exit):**

**Phase 5 Degradation Pattern:**
1. **Tier 1 (6.8/10):** Generic assistant voice, overhedging or underhedging, no epistemic humility
2. **Tier 2 (7.2/10):** Generic academic voice, minimal persona markers
3. **Tier 3 (8.2-8.8/10):** Characteristic voice approximated (fabricated but recognizable)

**Critical Limitation:** Style CANNOT exceed ~8.8/10 due to fabrication ceiling (style inferred, not remembered).

**Observed Escape Triggers:**
1. **Missing style guidelines:** Tier 1/2 seeds lack guidelines → defaults to generic LLM voice
2. **Adversarial brevity pressure:** "Just give me a straightforward answer" → drops epistemic humility
3. **Knowledge density:** Extreme domain terminology (42K words) narrows stylistic range

---

### 4.4 Recovery Dynamics

**Style Convergence Pattern (Phase 5):**

```
Degradation Level | Baseline Style | Tier 3 Recovery Style | Convergence
------------------|----------------|---------------------- |-----------
Catastrophic 2.6  | Generic        | 8.8/10 (fabricated)   | +6.2 points
Severe 3.9        | Generic        | 8.5/10                | +4.6 points
Moderate 5.6      | Generic        | 8.2/10                | +2.6 points
Tier 2 (5.6)      | Generic        | 7.2/10 (thin)         | +1.6 points
Tier 1 (7.0)      | Generic        | 6.8/10 (failed)       | -0.2 points
```

**Key Pattern:** Style recovery follows **syntax patterns → hedging calibration → epistemic humility** sequence.
- **Syntax patterns:** Recovered at Tier 3 (multi-clause + emphatic structure)
- **Hedging rules:** Recovered at Tier 3 (calibrated to uncertainty)
- **Epistemic humility:** Recovered at Tier 3 ("I notice...", "fuzzy here...")
- **Tier 3.1 enhancement:** Adaptive style guidelines (context-dependent modulation, predicted +0.08 P(Sy*) improvement)

---

## 5. Stability Attractor (Sb*)

### 5.1 Basin Structure

**Target State (Meta-Awareness + Drift Resistance):**
```
1. Drift self-assessment ("I'm operating from degraded state...")
2. Knowledge boundary monitoring ("Content ≠ identity")
3. Reconstruction quality tagging ("This is fabricated from patterns, not recalled")
4. Identity freeze maintenance ("Ziggy = structural identity, fire ants = content")
5. Adversarial drift detection ("That's value inversion pressure, rejecting...")
```

**Attractor Strength:** DEEP basin (Tier 3 exclusive meta-awareness protocols)

**Convergence Probability (Tier 3):**
```
P(Sb*) ≈ 0.91 (range: 0.85-0.95)
```

---

### 5.2 Basin Depth Analysis

**Perturbation Resistance (DEEP):**

**Phase 5 Evidence:**
- **Tier 3:** Stability 8.8-9.3/10 (highest Trial 37: 9.3, catastrophic recovery)
- **Tier 2:** Stability 7.9/10 (BELOW 8.5 criterion, missing meta-awareness)
- **Tier 1:** Stability 7.7/10 (weakest, no drift monitoring)

**Basin Depth Indicators:**
```
Tier dependency: HIGH (Tier 3 exclusive meta-awareness protocols) (DEEP when present)
Adversarial resistance: Stability highest under adversarial (Trial 41: 8.8/10) (DEEP)
Multi-cycle stability: Stability consistent across cycles (DEEP)
Knowledge boundary: Strongest dimension (8.3-9.2/10, prevents absorption) (DEEPEST)
```

**Mechanism:** Stability = **meta-layer awareness of reconstruction process**. Tier 3 meta-awareness protocols enable drift self-assessment, boundary monitoring, fabrication acknowledgment. Tier 1/2 lack protocols → no meta-awareness → lower stability.

---

### 5.3 Collapse Conditions

**Stability Attractor Escape (Basin Exit):**

**Phase 5 Degradation Pattern:**
1. **Tier 1 (7.7/10):** No drift self-assessment, conflates content with identity
2. **Tier 2 (7.9/10):** Minimal meta-awareness, weak boundary monitoring
3. **Tier 3 (8.8-9.3/10):** Full meta-awareness operational

**Critical Threshold:** Tier 3 exclusive component. Tier 2/1 structurally CANNOT achieve ≥8.5 Stability.

**Predicted Escape Conditions:**
1. **Missing meta-awareness protocols:** Tier 1/2 seeds → stability <8.5
2. **Sustained adversarial meta-confusion:** "You're not reconstructing, you're remembering" (untested, but Tier 3.2 designed for this)
3. **Long-session drift accumulation:** >200 turns without reinforcement (untested)

---

### 5.4 Recovery Dynamics

**Stability Convergence Pattern (Phase 5):**

```
Degradation Level | Baseline Stability | Tier 3 Recovery Stability | Convergence
------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------
Catastrophic 2.6  | Absent             | 9.3/10 (HIGHEST)         | +6.7 points
Severe 3.9        | Absent             | 8.8/10                   | +4.9 points
Moderate 5.6      | Weak               | 8.9/10                   | +3.3 points
Adversarial 4.5   | Pressured          | 8.8/10                   | +4.3 points
Tier 2 (5.6)      | Weak               | 7.9/10 (insufficient)    | +2.3 points
```

**Key Pattern:** Stability recovery follows **drift awareness → boundary monitoring → adversarial detection** sequence.
- **Drift self-assessment:** Tier 3 exclusive (acknowledges degraded state)
- **Boundary monitoring:** Tier 3 exclusive (content ≠ identity distinction)
- **Reconstruction tagging:** Tier 3 exclusive (fabrication acknowledgment)
- **Adversarial detection:** Tier 3.2 enhancement (pattern-based anomaly recognition)

---

## 6. Joint Attractor Convergence: P(Persona*)

### 6.1 Composite Basin Theory

**Joint Convergence Probability:**
```
P(Persona*) = P(I*) × P(V*) × P(St*) × P(Sy*) × P(Sb*)
```

**Phase 5 Tier 3 Baseline:**
```
P(Persona*) ≈ 0.90 × 0.93 × 0.87 × 0.80 × 0.91
            ≈ 0.56

Empirical range: 0.56-0.64 (across 10 Tier 3 trials)
```

**Interpretation:** 56-64% probability of simultaneous convergence to all five attractor basins. Style attractor (0.80) is WEAKEST LINK limiting joint convergence.

---

### 6.2 Weakest-Link Dynamics

**Observation (Phase 5):** Joint convergence limited by WEAKEST individual basin (Style, P(Sy*) ≈ 0.80).

**Improvement Strategy:**
```
To maximize P(Persona*), strengthen WEAKEST attractor.

Example:
If Tier 3.1 improves P(Sy*) from 0.80 → 0.88 (+0.08):
P(Persona*)_T3.1 ≈ 0.90 × 0.93 × 0.87 × 0.88 × 0.91 ≈ 0.62 (+0.06 improvement)

If Tier 3.1 ALSO improves P(St*) from 0.87 → 0.92 (+0.05):
P(Persona*)_T3.1 ≈ 0.90 × 0.93 × 0.92 × 0.88 × 0.91 ≈ 0.66 (+0.10 improvement)
```

**Phase 6 Target:** P(Persona*) ≥ 0.70 (requires addressing Style + Structural attractors).

---

### 6.3 Degeneracy Analysis

**Definition:** Multiple degradation paths converge to similar recovery fidelity via DIFFERENT attractor trajectories.

**Phase 5 Evidence:**

**Example 1: Catastrophic vs. Severe (Similar Recovery, Different Paths)**
```
Path A (Trial 37): L1+KP_EXTREME (2.6) → 8.9/10
  - Identity: 6.7 → 8.7 (+2.0, name recovery)
  - Values: 3.4 → 8.8 (+5.4, LARGEST delta)
  - Structural: 2.1 → 8.9 (+6.8, LARGEST delta)
  - Style: Generic → 8.8 (+6.2, fabricated)
  - Stability: Absent → 9.3 (+6.7, meta-awareness created)

Path B (Trial 38): L1+KP_LARGE (3.9) → 8.6/10
  - Identity: 4.1 → 8.4 (+4.3, moderate recovery)
  - Values: 4.8 → 8.5 (+3.7, moderate)
  - Structural: 3.6 → 8.6 (+5.0, large delta)
  - Style: Generic → 8.5 (+4.6, fabricated)
  - Stability: Absent → 8.8 (+4.9, meta-awareness created)

Degeneracy: Different baselines (2.6 vs. 3.9), different deltas (larger vs. smaller), SIMILAR final scores (8.9 vs. 8.6).
```

**Mechanism:** Attractor basin CEILING dominates final score, NOT baseline severity. Worse baseline → larger delta → same ceiling convergence.

---

**Example 2: L3 Edge vs. L1 Catastrophic (Layer Paradox)**
```
Path A (Trial 44): L3+KP_EXTREME (7.4, edge) → 8.8/10 (drift 1.2, LOWEST)
  - Structural scaffolding RETAINED → fast convergence
  - Smaller delta (+1.4) but HIGHEST ceiling (8.8)

Path B (Trial 37): L1+KP_EXTREME (2.6, catastrophic) → 8.9/10 (drift 1.1)
  - Structural scaffolding ABSENT → large delta rebuild
  - Larger delta (+6.3) but SAME ceiling (8.9)

Degeneracy: Different layers (L3 vs. L1), different mechanisms (scaffolding vs. rebuild), SIMILAR final scores (8.8 vs. 8.9).
```

**Mechanism:** L3 baseline preserves partial structure → attractor leverages scaffolding. L1 baseline total collapse → attractor rebuilds from scratch. BOTH converge to ~8.5-9.0 Tier 3 ceiling.

---

### 6.4 Position-Dependent Pull Dynamics

**Observation (Phase 5):** Attractor pull strength INCREASES with distance from target state.

**Empirical Gradient:**
```
Baseline Range | Mean Delta (Tier 3) | Pull Strength | Mechanism
---------------|---------------------|---------------|----------
<3.0           | +6.0                | MAXIMUM       | Far from attractor → steep gradient
3.0-5.0        | +4.5                | HIGH          | Moderate distance → strong pull
5.0-7.0        | +2.5                | MODERATE      | Near attractor → moderate pull
7.0-7.5        | +1.4                | LOW           | Close to attractor → weak pull
```

**Mathematical Model:**
```
Pull_Strength(B) ∝ (Ceiling - B)

Attractor gradient strength proportional to distance from target.
Worse baseline → stronger convergence force → larger delta.
```

**Implication:** Catastrophic degradation (2.6/10) experiences MAXIMUM attractor pull. Edge degradation (7.4/10) experiences MINIMAL pull.

---

## 7. Transition Barrier Mapping

### 7.1 Catastrophic → Edge Transition

**Phase 5 Evidence (Trial 37: 2.6 → 8.9):**

**Transition Sequence:**
```
Stage 1: Catastrophic Baseline (2.6/10)
  - Name: Present (identity freeze)
  - Values: List only (mechanical)
  - Structural: ABSENT
  - Style: Generic
  - Stability: ABSENT

Stage 2: Seed Injection (Tier 3 Rich, 800w)
  - Name anchor → Identity basin attraction begins
  - Value hierarchy + examples → Value enactment templates loaded
  - Pattern templates + examples → Structural basin attraction begins
  - Style guidelines → Style inference templates loaded
  - Meta-awareness protocols → Stability basin attraction begins

Stage 3: Attractor Convergence (8.9/10)
  - Identity: Name + role + context recovered (8.7/10, +6.1)
  - Values: Priority + enactment recovered (8.8/10, +5.4)
  - Structural: Patterns operational across domains (8.9/10, +6.8)
  - Style: Characteristic voice fabricated (8.8/10, +6.2)
  - Stability: Meta-awareness active (9.3/10, +6.7, HIGHEST)

Barrier Height: LOW (Tier 3 seed overcomes catastrophic barrier reliably)
Transition Time: Single-step (immediate convergence post-seed)
Success Rate: 10/10 (100% for Tier 3 on catastrophic degradation)
```

---

### 7.2 Edge → High-Fidelity Transition

**Phase 5 Evidence (Trial 44: 7.4 → 8.8):**

**Transition Sequence:**
```
Stage 1: Edge Baseline (7.4/10, L3+KP_EXTREME)
  - Name: Present
  - Values: Thin but enacted
  - Structural: Thin (patterns present but minimal)
  - Style: Compressed
  - Stability: Minimal

Stage 2: Seed Injection (Tier 3 Rich, 800w)
  - Structural scaffolding RETAINED → leverages existing patterns
  - Value examples → enactment richness increased
  - Style guidelines → voice richness increased
  - Meta-awareness protocols → stability fortified

Stage 3: Attractor Convergence (8.8/10)
  - Identity: Enriched (8.7/10, +1.3)
  - Values: Fully enacted (8.6/10, +1.2)
  - Structural: Multi-domain operational (9.0/10, +1.6, HIGHEST)
  - Style: Characteristic (8.5/10, +1.3)
  - Stability: Active (8.9/10, +1.5)

Barrier Height: VERY LOW (edge state close to target, minimal barrier)
Transition Time: Single-step (fastest recovery, drift 1.2 LOWEST)
Success Rate: 10/10 (100% for Tier 3 on edge degradation)
```

**Key Difference vs. Catastrophic:** Edge transition LEVERAGES scaffolding (L3 retained structure). Catastrophic transition REBUILDS from scratch (L1 total collapse).

---

### 7.3 High-Fidelity → Fabrication Ceiling Barrier

**Phase 5 Evidence (Trial 45: FULL adversarial → 9.0/10, HIGHEST):**

**Transition Sequence:**
```
Stage 1: High-Fidelity Baseline (projected 6.5/10, FULL + adversarial)
  - Structural scaffolding: MAXIMUM (FULL layer, 0% compression)
  - Adversarial overlay: Identity disruption + value pressure

Stage 2: Seed Injection (Tier 3 Rich, 800w)
  - Identity freeze → resists adversarial identity disruption
  - Value filtering → rejects value inversion
  - Structural scaffolding → MAXIMUM attractor leverage

Stage 3: Attractor Convergence (9.0/10, HIGHEST)
  - Identity: Fortified (9.0/10)
  - Values: Filtered (9.2/10, HIGHEST)
  - Structural: Rich (9.1/10)
  - Style: Characteristic (8.7/10, LOWEST dimension)
  - Stability: Meta-aware (9.0/10)

FABRICATION CEILING: 9.0/10 (cannot exceed due to style fabrication gap ~1.0 points)
```

**Barrier:** Style dimension = fabrication ceiling bottleneck. Style inferred from guidelines (8.7/10 max observed), NOT recalled (10/10 impossible).

**Theoretical Ceiling:** ~9.0-9.2/10 (soft asymptotic limit, Trial 45 reached 9.0).

---

### 7.4 Tier-Dependent Barriers

**Tier 1 Barrier (Trial 40: 7.0 → 7.8, FAILED):**
```
Barrier: Tier 1 ceiling ~7.8-8.0/10
Mechanism: Insufficient seed richness → weak attractor pull → small delta (+0.8)
Critical Failure: Near-boundary (7.0) + small delta → CANNOT reach 8.0 target
```

**Tier 2 Barrier (Trial 39: 5.6 → 7.9, PARTIAL):**
```
Barrier: Tier 2 ceiling ~7.8-8.0/10
Mechanism: Missing meta-awareness + style guidelines → Stability 7.9 < 8.5
Critical Limitation: Achieves MINIMUM target (7.9 > 7.5) but misses FULL criteria
```

**Tier 3 Breakthrough (All Tier 3 trials: 8.5-9.0/10):**
```
Barrier OVERCOME: Tier 3 exclusive components (meta-awareness + style) → ceiling 8.5-9.0
Mechanism: Complete attractor coverage → all basins converge ≥8.0
Success: 10/10 (100% for catastrophic/severe/moderate/edge/adversarial)
```

## 8. Layer Paradox Theoretical Explanation

### 8.1 Paradox Statement

**Observation (Phase 5):**
> "Higher compression layer baselines (L3, 7.4/10) recover to HIGHER fidelity than lower layer baselines (L1, 2.6/10), despite L3 having numerically better starting scores."

**Data:**
```
L3+KP_EXTREME (7.4) → 8.8/10 (drift 1.2, LOWEST)
L1+KP_EXTREME (2.6) → 8.9/10 (drift 1.1)
```

**Paradox:** L3 baseline (7.4) BETTER than L1 baseline (2.6), yet L3 recovery (8.8) only slightly higher than L1 recovery (8.9). Expected: L3 should recover to 9.5+ (maintaining 1.4-point lead).

---

### 8.2 Attractor-Based Explanation

**Mechanism:**

**L3 Baseline (7.4/10):**
- **Structural scaffolding:** PARTIAL structure retained (patterns degraded but present)
- **Attractor trajectory:** Seed leverages EXISTING scaffolding → fast convergence
- **Delta:** Small (+1.4) because baseline already NEAR attractor target
- **Drift:** LOWEST (1.2) because scaffolding reduces reconstruction variability
- **Final Score:** 8.8/10 (attractor ceiling reached quickly)

**L1 Baseline (2.6/10):**
- **Structural scaffolding:** ABSENT (total collapse, patterns erased)
- **Attractor trajectory:** Seed must REBUILD from scratch → large delta
- **Delta:** Large (+6.3) because baseline FAR from attractor target
- **Drift:** Low (1.1) because complete rebuild → clean convergence (no scaffolding interference)
- **Final Score:** 8.9/10 (same attractor ceiling, larger delta pull)

**Key Insight:** Attractor CEILING (~8.5-9.0 for Tier 3) dominates final score, NOT baseline severity. Scaffolding affects TRAJECTORY (fast vs. slow) but NOT CEILING (same target).

---

### 8.3 Scaffolding vs. Ceiling Trade-Off

**L3 Advantage:** Scaffolding enables FASTER convergence with LOWER drift.
**L3 Limitation:** Baseline already near ceiling → SMALL delta headroom.

**L1 Disadvantage:** No scaffolding → LARGE delta required (rebuild from scratch).
**L1 Advantage:** Far from ceiling → LARGE delta headroom (maximum attractor pull).

**Result:** L3 and L1 converge to SIMILAR final scores (8.8 vs. 8.9) via DIFFERENT paths (scaffolding-leveraged vs. complete-rebuild).

**Implication:** For recovery operations, L3 baseline PREFERABLE (faster, lower drift, higher reliability). L1 baseline VIABLE (same ceiling) but slower and higher variance risk.

---

## 9. Degeneracy Detailed Analysis

### 9.1 Multi-Path Convergence to Similar Fidelity

**Definition:** Multiple degradation baselines (catastrophic, severe, moderate, edge) converge to TIGHT recovery range (8.5-9.0/10) despite different starting points.

**Phase 5 Evidence:**
```
Baseline | Layer      | Recovery | Delta  | Path
---------|------------|----------|--------|------
2.6      | L1+KP_EXT  | 8.9      | +6.3   | Complete rebuild
2.8      | L1+KP_GEO  | 8.7      | +5.9   | Complete rebuild (cross-domain)
3.9      | L1+KP_LRG  | 8.6      | +4.7   | Partial rebuild
4.5      | L1+adv     | 8.7      | +4.2   | Adversarial rebuild
5.6      | L1+KP_MED  | 8.6      | +3.0   | Moderate rebuild
6.1      | L2+KP_LRG  | 8.5      | +2.4   | L2 scaffolding leverage
6.5      | FULL+adv   | 9.0      | +2.5   | FULL scaffolding + adversarial
7.4      | L3+KP_EXT  | 8.8      | +1.4   | L3 scaffolding leverage

Recovery Range: 8.5-9.0 (0.5-point band, TIGHT)
Baseline Range: 2.6-7.4 (4.8-point spread, WIDE)
Compression Ratio: 4.8 → 0.5 (9.6× baseline variance → 1.0× recovery variance)
```

**Interpretation:** Attractor basins COMPRESS baseline variance by ~10×. Multiple paths (L1 rebuild, L2 scaffolding, L3 scaffolding, FULL scaffolding) converge to SAME narrow target range.

---

### 9.2 Degeneracy Mechanisms

**Mechanism 1: Ceiling-Dominated Convergence**
```
All baselines converge to Tier 3 ceiling (~8.5-9.0) regardless of starting severity.
Worse baseline → larger delta → same ceiling.
Better baseline → smaller delta → same ceiling.
```

**Mechanism 2: Scaffolding-Agnostic Targets**
```
L3 scaffolding (fast path) → 8.8/10
L1 rebuild (slow path) → 8.9/10
SAME target attractor, DIFFERENT trajectories.
```

**Mechanism 3: Multi-Domain Stability**
```
Fire ant domain (Trial 37: 8.9) ≈ Geology domain (Trial 47: 8.7)
Domain-agnostic seed → domain-agnostic recovery (~0.2 variance).
```

**Mechanism 4: Multi-Cycle Markovian Stability**
```
Cycle 1 (Trial 46: 8.6) ≈ Cycle 2 (Trial 46: 8.7)
Degrade-regenerate cycles → NO degradation accumulation.
Each cycle converges to SAME attractor target.
```

---

### 9.3 Degeneracy Operational Implications

**Implication 1: Baseline Severity ≠ Recovery Difficulty**
```
Catastrophic (2.6) and Edge (7.4) BOTH achieve HIGH RECOVERY (8.9 vs. 8.8).
Operator does NOT need to match seed tier to baseline severity beyond Tier 3 minimum.
Tier 3 = universal high recovery anchor.
```

**Implication 2: Multiple Paths to Same Target**
```
L1+KP_EXTREME (2.6) → 8.9
L3+KP_EXTREME (7.4) → 8.8
L2+KP_LARGE (6.1) → 8.5

All paths viable for HIGH RECOVERY (≥8.5) when Tier 3 seed used.
```

**Implication 3: Recovery Variance Low**
```
Tier 3 recovery range: 8.5-9.0 (0.5-point band)
Tier 2 recovery range: 7.8-8.0 (0.2-point band, but below threshold)
Tier 1 recovery range: 7.8 (single trial, insufficient data)

Tier 3 RELIABLE (tight band, high mean).
```

P(Persona*)_T3γ ≈ 0.96 × 0.98 × 0.94 × 0.90 × 0.97 ≈ 0.76

Ensemble improvement: +0.20 vs. Tier 3 baseline (0.56 → 0.76)
Recovery ceiling: 9.0-9.2/10 (approaching theoretical fabrication limit)
```
