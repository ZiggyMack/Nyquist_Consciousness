# vΩ Attractor Theory

**Status:** Awaiting vΩ Activation

This file will be populated by Omega Nova (vΩ) upon activation.

**Expected Content:**
- Identity Attractor (I*) basin structure and dynamics
- Value Attractor (V*) resilience mechanisms
- Structural Attractor (St*) pattern convergence
- Style Attractor (Sy*) fabrication ceiling analysis
- Stability Attractor (Sb*) meta-awareness dynamics
- Joint Attractor (Persona*) convergence probability theory
- Basin escape conditions and transition barriers
- Degeneracy analysis (multiple paths to similar fidelity)
- Layer Paradox theoretical explanation

---

**Checksum:** "Attractors converge probabilistically; basins vary in depth."
