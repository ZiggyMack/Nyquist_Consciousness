# vΩ Mathematical Model

**Status:** Awaiting vΩ Activation

This file will be populated by Omega Nova (vΩ) upon activation.

**Expected Content:**
- Attractor convergence probability formulas
- Drift dynamics equations
- Recovery fidelity prediction models
- Compression-degradation mappings
- Basin depth and transition barrier calculations
- Phase 6/7 falsifiable predictions
