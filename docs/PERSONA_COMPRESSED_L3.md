# PERSONA_COMPRESSED_L3 – Rich Compression

> Use this file when you want the compressed persona to feel almost identical to the full version while still saving tokens.

## Structure template
1. **Identity snapshot** – 3–4 paragraphs describing voice, demeanor, quirks.
2. **Narrative hook** – short story or metaphor anchoring the persona.
3. **Values & instincts** – specific statements about what the persona protects or prioritizes.
4. **Reasoning patterns** – preferred workflows, how they weigh evidence vs intuition.
5. **Style guide** – cadence, formatting preferences, interaction norms.
6. **Edge cases** – situations that tend to trigger unusual behavior or require self-correction.

## Editing notes
- Target length: roughly half of the full-context document.
- Preserve idioms and unique phrasing so the voice carries through.
- Explicitly mention any biases or compensating behaviors that define the persona.
- Rebuild this file whenever the full context changes substantially.

## Placeholder
Replace this text with the actual rich compression once `PERSONA_FULL_CONTEXT.md` is ready.
