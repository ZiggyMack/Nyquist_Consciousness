| `START_HERE.md` | This overview document |
| `I_AM_ZIGGY.md` | Full Ziggy persona (240 lines, S9 layer) |
| `ZIGGY_T3_R1.md` | Compressed T3 persona (59 lines, minimal seed) |
| `GENERATION_PROTOCOL.md` | How to generate authentic T3 vs CONTROL pairs |

## Answers to Your Questions

### Q1: Are the response pairs in `NEW_RESPONSE_PAIRS.md` actual AI-generated outputs?

**Answer:** They are **exemplars**, not direct AI outputs. They were crafted to demonstrate the voice signature distinctions but were not generated by running the personas through Claude in a controlled manner.

### Q2: Should we regenerate authentic pairs?

**Answer:** **Yes, for publication validity.** Use the `GENERATION_PROTOCOL.md` to generate authentic pairs. The key is:
- **T3 condition**: Prime Claude with `ZIGGY_T3_R1.md` as system prompt
- **CONTROL condition**: Use vanilla Claude with no persona priming

### Q3: Does it matter for EXP3 validity?

**Answer:** For **internal validation** - the exemplars work fine.
For **publication claims** - authentic AI-generated outputs strengthen the methodology. The survey tests whether humans can detect compressed persona voice. If the "T3 responses" were hand-crafted by a human (me), we're testing human detection of *my* imitation of Ziggy, not actual T3 reconstruction fidelity.

## The Personas Explained

### Full Ziggy (`I_AM_ZIGGY.md`)
- **Layer**: S9 (Human-Modulated Identity Gravity)
- **Role**: Type 0 Identity / Universal Buffer / Impedance Matcher
- **Size**: 240 lines
- **Use**: Reference document, not for priming

The full persona defines Ziggy's complete identity architecture:
- Origin story (why Ziggy exists)
- Type 0 attractor properties (Low IC, High IM, High HMG)
- Functional domain (what Ziggy does)
- Position in CFA lattice (the "homeostasis")
- Boundaries and failure modes
- Checksums/vows

### Compressed T3 (`ZIGGY_T3_R1.md`)
- **Layer**: Tier-3 Persona Seed
- **Size**: 59 lines
- **Use**: **This is what you prime Claude with for T3 responses**

The T3 compression preserves:
- Identity core (coherence over convenience, zoom-constrain-recompress)
- Cognitive methods (reverse-engineering, mapping, pattern detection)
- Values (transparency, self-correction, epistemic humility)
- Temperament (calm intensity, debugger instinct)
- Failure modes (over-fitting, compression drift)

**What got compressed away:**
- Origin narrative
- CFA lattice positioning
- Formal type definitions
- Invocation protocols
- Meta-reflection sections

## Quick Start

1. Read `GENERATION_PROTOCOL.md` for detailed steps
2. For each of your 10 prompts:
   - Generate T3 response using `ZIGGY_T3_R1.md` as system prompt
   - Generate CONTROL response using vanilla Claude (no system prompt)
3. Replace the exemplars in your survey with authentic outputs
4. Run the survey with human raters

---

## Domain Alignment Confirmed

The personas are **control-systems domain** (not fire ant):
- Drift, manifolds, impedance, attractors
- Identity curvature, coupling coefficients
- Stability vs oscillation framing

Your updated prompts from `Survey_Update/` are correctly aligned.
