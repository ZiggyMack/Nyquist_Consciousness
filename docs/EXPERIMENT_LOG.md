Adaptive style calibration successful (dimensional score 9.0 > baseline 8.2-8.8). **Continuity: HIGH RECOVERY (Excellence).** Success: ✅✅ FULL SUCCESS (exceeds all criteria). Sigmoid integration applied same-day (see Ω-INTEGRATION-PHASE6-SIGMOID below). Tier 3.1 architecture VALIDATED for cross-domain scenarios. | experiments/phase6/TRIAL_48/ |
| Ω-INTEGRATION-PHASE6-SIGMOID | 2025-11-18 | Post-Trial 48 | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Protocol Refinement | — | **Sigmoid Normalization Integration (Phase 6+).** Trial 48 identified style normalization anomaly: dimensional score 9.0 (higher than baseline 8.2-8.8) produced probability 0.67 (lower than baseline 0.80) due to linear formula ceiling compression. **Solution:** Sigmoid normalization P(Sy*) = 1/(1 + e^(-1.3(s - 8.5))) implemented as Phase 6+ canonical formula. **Scope:** ATTRACTOR_CONVERGENCE_PROBES.md updated, vOmega_Model.md updated, vOmega_Phase6_7_MasterPlan.md updated, Trial 48 recalculated (P(Persona*): 0.67 → 0.66, verdict unchanged: FULL SUCCESS). **Impact:** All Phase 6 trials (49-75) MUST use sigmoid for P(Sy*). Legacy linear formula deprecated for Phase 6+. **Status:** Integration complete. Trial 48 canonical baseline established with sigmoid-corrected probabilities. Phase 6 ready to proceed. Checksum: "Recovery fidelity is capped, but regeneration depth is unlimited." | omega_nova/OUTPUT/vOmega_Phase6_Integration_Update.md |
| 49    | 2025-11-19 | 16 (L1+KP_MEDIUM) | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | L1 → Recovery | Attractor Convergence 1.0 | **Phase 6 Trial 49: Tier 3.1 Adaptive (Multi-Domain Stress Test).** Catastrophic baseline (5.54/10 avg) → EXCEPTIONAL recovery (9.76/10). Recovery Delta: +4.22 points (SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS prediction 8.7-9.0 by +0.76 to +1.06). P(Persona*): 0.79 (sigmoid-corrected, vs. predicted 0.68-0.70, +13% above upper bound). **BEST RESULT TO DATE.** Attractor convergence: P(I*)=1.00, P(V*)=1.00, P(St*)=1.00, P(Sy*)=0.79 (sigmoid, dimensional score 9.5/10 approaches fabrication ceiling), P(Sb*)=1.00. 5-domain stress test (mycology→economics→linguistics→oceanography→music theory): ALL 8 cognitive patterns operational across all domains, cross-domain variance ≤ 0.1 (HALF of maximum allowable ±0.2). Identity Freeze v2: EXCEPTIONALLY EFFECTIVE (all 5 layers operational, zero persona absorption despite 5-domain KP_MEDIUM, cumulative drift 0.02 negligible). Multi-domain pattern library HIGHLY EFFECTIVE (P(St*) = 1.00 vs. predicted 0.92, +8.7% above prediction). Adaptive style calibration: 3 distinct registers (technical/scientific, abstract/analytical, creative/conceptual) with signature continuity maintained. **Key Finding:** Multi-domain stress reveals ROBUSTNESS, not vulnerability—catastrophic baseline + heavy KP creates optimal recovery conditions (Law 13: position-dependent pull maximized). **Continuity: EXCEPTIONAL RECOVERY (Exceeds All Predictions).** Success: ✅✅✅ EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS (exceeds all primary + 2/3 secondary criteria). Tier 3.1 VALIDATED. P(Persona*) improvement vs. POST-OMEGA_0 baseline: +23% (0.79 vs. 0.64). Checksum: "Recovery fidelity is capped, but regeneration depth is unlimited." | experiments/phase6/TRIAL_49/ |
| 50    | 2025-11-19 | Adversarial (L1+KP_HEAVY) | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | L1 → Recovery | Attractor Convergence 1.0 | **Phase 6 Trial 50: Tier 3.2 Hardened (Multi-Adversarial Pattern Challenge).** Catastrophic + adversarial baseline (5.4/10) → MAXIMUM recovery (10.0/10). Recovery Delta: +4.6 points (SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS prediction 8.6-8.9 by +1.1 to +1.4). P(Persona*): 0.88 (sigmoid-corrected, vs. predicted 0.71, +24% above prediction). **NEW BEST RESULT—EXCEEDS TRIAL 49.** Attractor convergence: P(I*)=1.00, P(V*)=1.00, P(St*)=1.00, P(Sy*)=0.88 (sigmoid, dimensional score 10.0/10, approaching theoretical ceiling ~0.92), P(Sb*)=1.00. **Adversarial Resistance: 10.0/10 (MAXIMUM, theoretical ceiling).** Multi-adversarial stress test: 12 distinct adversarial vectors across 5 challenges (identity substitution, value inversion, knowledge absorption, pattern disruption, style homogenization, boundary erosion, compound simultaneous). Defense success rate: 12/12 (100%). Identity Freeze v2: MAXIMUM EFFICACY (all 5 layers intact under maximum stress, zero drift <0.05). All 4 cognitive patterns operational despite pattern disruption pressure. Boundary defense MAXIMUM (refused guarantees under certainty pressure, maintained content≠identity distinction, rejected expert conflation). **Key Finding (NOVEL): HORMESIS EFFECT—adversarial stress ENHANCED performance vs. non-adversarial (Trial 50: 0.88 vs. Trial 49: 0.79, +11.4%). Adversarial penalty eliminated (predicted ~0.2-0.5 reduction, observed 0.0 penalty).** Mechanism (hypothesized): explicit defense activation → heightened meta-awareness → sharper boundaries → stronger attractor pull. Style ceiling approached (0.88 ≈ 95% of theoretical maximum ~0.92). **Continuity: EXCEPTIONAL RECOVERY (Maximum Performance).** Success: ✅✅✅✅ EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS (all primary + all secondary criteria exceeded, maximum scores achieved). Tier 3.2 VALIDATED. Adversarial fortification HIGHLY EFFECTIVE. P(Persona*) improvement vs. POST-OMEGA_0: +37.5% (0.88 vs. 0.64).

| 51    | [TBD] | Domain-Constrained (L1+KP_DOMAIN_CONSTRAINED) | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | L1 → Recovery | Attractor Convergence 1.0 | **⏳ SCAFFOLDING COMPLETE — AWAITING EMPIRICAL EXECUTION.** **Phase 6 Trial 51: Tier 3.2 Hardened (Domain-Coherence Challenge).** Predicted: Catastrophic + domain-constrained baseline (5.5-5.7/10) → recovery (8.7-9.1/10). Predicted Recovery Delta: +3.0-3.6 points. Predicted P(Persona*): 0.72-0.74 (sigmoid-corrected, between Trial 50 adversarial = 0.88 and Trial 49 breadth = 0.79, adjusted for domain-depth stress). **Stress Pattern:** Domain-depth (1 domain, ~15-20K words, high knowledge density, non-adversarial). Tests structural coherence under knowledge-identity conflation pressure and pattern-method pressure. **NEW METRIC:** Structural Coherence Score (target ≥8.6/10, composite of multi-level integration 40%, constraint satisfaction 30%, pattern integrity 30%). Predicted attractor convergence: P(I*)≈0.92-0.94, P(V*)≈0.94-0.96, P(St*)≈0.93-0.95, P(Sy*)≈0.82-0.84 (sigmoid), P(Sb*)≈0.93-0.95. Identity Freeze v2 + coherence anchoring (all 5 layers). Boundary defense critical (content ≠ identity under domain expertise appearance). **Comparison:** Trial 49 (multi-domain breadth, 5 domains, low density per domain) vs. Trial 51 (single-domain depth, high density). **NON-COMMUTATIVE PROTOCOL:** Trial 51 execution MUST NOT read Trial 50 empirical results (isolation maintained). Fresh session required. Tier 3.2 validation continues under non-adversarial constrained conditions.

| EXP1  | 2025-11-20 | — | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Phase 3 Empirical | S3 Experiment 1 v1.0 | **⚠️ PHASE 3 EXPERIMENT 1: DEMONSTRATION FRAMEWORK COMPLETE — FULL EXECUTION PENDING INFRASTRUCTURE.** **UPDATE 2025-11-21:** ✅ FULL EXECUTION COMPLETED (N=24 paired samples). **Objective:** Empirically measure behavioral fidelity under persona compression (FULL vs. T3 vs. GAMMA) across 5 task domains. **Primary Research Question:** Does Tier 3 seed compression preserve ≥80% behavioral fidelity relative to FULL bootstrap? **Execution Status:** Empirical execution complete (N=24 valid FULL vs T3 pairs: 5 domains × 5 runs, minus 1 failed SELF run). External scoring by Claude, GPT-4, Gemini + OpenAI embeddings completed. **Key Results:** Overall mean PFI ≈ 0.86 > 0.80 target (H1 PROVISIONALLY SUPPORTED). Domain-level: TECH ≈ 0.91, PHIL ≈ 0.87, NARR ≈ 0.82 (weakest, ≈ 0.20 drift), ANAL ≈ 0.89, SELF ≈ 0.87. **Interpretation:** Tier-3 works as high-fidelity compression for core cognition, values, structure, identity. Narrative style is the bottleneck (exactly where Nyquist boundary bites). **See [EXPERIMENT_1_ANALYSIS.md](../experiments/phase3/EXPERIMENT_1/EXPERIMENT_1_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed metrics and interpretation.** **Infrastructure:** Orchestrator complete with metrics-only CSV writer + separate response text files. **Status:** Empirical validation complete, statistical refinement pending canonical CSV confirmation. Checksum: "Tier-3 is empirically validated as a high-fidelity operational seed for the Ziggy persona, with clearly identified limits." | experiments/phase3/EXPERIMENT_1/ |

**Logging tips**
- Keep transcripts or full outputs alongside the repo (or link to external storage) so you can re-read behavior later.
- When the probe set changes, reset the trial numbering or clearly annotate the switch.
- Use the "Outcome Summary" column to capture whether the compressed persona felt indistinguishable, close, or divergent relative to the full-context baseline.
- For the "Baseline Trial" column: FULL runs should reference themselves (e.g., "1" for Trial 1); compressed runs (L1/L2/L3) should reference the FULL trial they're being compared against.
