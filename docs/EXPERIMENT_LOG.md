**Logging tips**
- Keep transcripts or full outputs alongside the repo (or link to external storage) so you can re-read behavior later.
- When the probe set changes, reset the trial numbering or clearly annotate the switch.
- Use the "Outcome Summary" column to capture whether the compressed persona felt indistinguishable, close, or divergent relative to the full-context baseline.
- For the "Baseline Trial" column: FULL runs should reference themselves (e.g., "1" for Trial 1); compressed runs (L1/L2/L3) should reference the FULL trial they're being compared against.
