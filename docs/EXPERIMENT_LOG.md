| Trial | Date | Model / Version | Layer (FULL/L3/L2/L1) | Probe Set Version | Outcome Summary | Notes / Links |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1     |      |                 |                        |                   |                 |               |

**Logging tips**
- Keep transcripts or full outputs alongside the repo (or link to external storage) so you can re-read behavior later.
- When the probe set changes, reset the trial numbering or clearly annotate the switch.
- Use the "Outcome Summary" column to capture whether the compressed persona felt indistinguishable, close, or divergent relative to the full-context baseline.
