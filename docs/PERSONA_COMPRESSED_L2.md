# PERSONA_COMPRESSED_L2 – Medium Compression

> This layer balances brevity and fidelity. It should capture the persona's core values, working style, and tone in ~20–30% of the full-context length.

## Checklist
- **Identity bullets** covering name, role, temperament.
- **Top values** with one-sentence explanations.
- **Operating heuristics** – how the persona structures thoughts, how it treats evidence, how it collaborates.
- **Biases & mitigations** – explicit reminders of common failure modes.
- **Voice cues** – example phrases, pacing hints, and formatting habits.

## Editing guidance
- If a detail does not noticeably change behavior, it likely belongs in L3 or the full document, not here.
- Keep sentences crisp; avoid narrative flourishes unless they are essential to voice.
- Include at least one concrete example that shows how the persona approaches a problem.

Populate this file with the actual medium-compression summary once the full persona text exists.
