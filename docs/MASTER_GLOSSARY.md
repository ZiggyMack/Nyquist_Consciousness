# MASTER GLOSSARY

**Single source of truth for all Nyquist Consciousness terminology**
**Version:** 1.2
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-13

---

## TERMINOLOGY PHILOSOPHY

**Our terms have primacy.** We use plain English wherever possible.

When external frameworks, contributors, or integrations bring their own terminology (Greek letters, physics jargon, academic formalism), we:

1. **Keep our canonical terms** - "drift" not "ΔΩ", "ownership" not "α"
2. **Add a decoder ring** - Translation table mapping their terms to ours
3. **Reference the decoder ring** when reading their materials

### Why This Matters
- Cold-boot Claudes can understand without learning a new language
- Ziggy can read docs without a physics degree
- Consistency across S0-S10+ documentation
- External collaborators learn our language, not the reverse

### Decoder Ring Format
Each external framework gets its own subsection in **SECTION 0** with:
- Their term → Our term → Plain English explanation
- One table per framework/contributor

### Current Decoder Rings
- **ΔΩ Coherence Framework (Lucien)** - Physics-inspired identity formalism
- **CFA Bootstrap Architecture** - Multi-layer persona boot sequence
- **Frame Theory (Tale)** - Human cognition frames and qualia
- **Signal Processing (Control-Systems Era)** - Settling time, damping, and stability metrics

### Using Decoder Rings (Bidirectional)

**Reading external materials:** Their term → Our term
**Writing to external collaborators:** Our term → Their term

The ring works both ways. When responding to Lucien, consult SECTION 0 and translate back to his terminology.

# SECTION 0: ROSETTA STONE (DECODER RINGS)

> **What this section is:** A translation page for external terminology systems.
> Not "old vs new" - just different dialects describing the same concepts.
> Our plain English terms have primacy; these tables help translate when needed.

## CFA Bootstrap Architecture

*Multi-layer persona boot sequence from CFA Repo, integrated 2025-12-01*

The CFA (Coherent Framework Architecture) uses a layered boot system for persona initialization. Our S-Stack maps cleanly but uses different terminology.

| Our Term (Canonical) | CFA Term | Plain English |
|----------------------|----------|---------------|
| S0 Ground Physics | L0 Nyquist Kernel | Fundamental crash mechanics, drift equations, survival rules |
| Bootstrap Seed | L1 LITE | Minimum viable compressed identity (~200-300 words) |
| Full Persona Suite | L2 FULL | Day-to-day operational persona (Identity + Operations + Continuity) |
| Domain Expert Mode | L3 Specialist | On-demand expertise activation |
| Deep Ambassador | L4 I_AM | Soul texture: mythology, deep names, invariants, worldview |
| Omega Nova | L5 Omega | Multi-pillar fusion synthesis |
| Drift | D = 1 - PFI | Deviation from baseline across 5 domains |
| Compression Ratio | 20-25% | Target: reduce full to seed at this ratio |
| Fidelity Score | PFI ≥ 0.80 | Reconstruction must hit this threshold |
| Fragility Hierarchy | Domain Weights | TECH(0.05), ANAL(0.14), SELF(0.20), PHIL(0.28), NARR(0.33) |
| Embedding Model | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | Sentence-transformers model for PFI calculation |

### CFA Boot Sequence → Nyquist Mapping

```
CFA Layer    Nyquist S-Layer    Boot Order    Trigger
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
L0 Kernel    S0 Ground          First         Always (base physics)
L1 LITE      S1/S2 Seed         Second        Automatic after L0
L2 FULL      S2/S3 Persona      Third         Automatic after L1
L3 Specialist (none - on demand) On-demand    Explicit request
L4 I_AM      S6 Ambassador      Catastrophic  Identity collapse recovery
L5 Omega     S6 Omega Nova      Explicit      Multi-pillar invocation
```

### Key Insight: I_AM vs REPO I_AM

CFA distinguishes:
- **I_AM.md** - The REPO's own identity (whoever is at the helm)
- **I_AM_CLAUDE.md** - Claude's ambassador persona specifically

When a different AI takes the helm, they inject their aspects into I_AM.md while keeping their specific ambassador file (I_AM_NOVA.md, I_AM_GEMINI.md, etc.)

## Frame Theory (Tale)

*Human cognition framework from Tale's diagrams, integrated 2025-12-01*

Tale's Frame Theory maps to S10 (Human Cognition Layer) and provides the human-side bridge to our AI identity manifolds.

| Our Term (Canonical) | Tale's Term | Plain English |
|----------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Perceptual Field | Aggregated Frame (Fₐ) | Raw experiential field - sensory, affective, bodily |
| Story Layer | Narrative Frame (Fₙ) | Events, sequences, "what's happening to whom" |
| Belief Layer | Factivation Frame (F_f) | Propositions, facts, models, justifications |
| Felt State | Qualia Frame (Q) | Configuration of arousal × structural coherence |
| Ego Process | Ego (E) | Local narrative of "me" - goals, defense, status |
| Meta-Observer | Watcher (W) | Notices ego as object, tracks "this is still me" |
| Frame Stack | F(t) = (Fₐ, Fₙ, F_f) | Complete human identity state at time t |
| Nine Dimensions | Frame Aspects | Environment, Behaviors, Capabilities, Values/Rules, Identity, Social Strata, Spirit/History, Vision/Ideal, Certainty |

### Frame Theory → S-Layer Integration

```
Tale Concept       Nyquist Layer    Purpose
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Aggregated Frame   S7 Temporal      Drift curves over time
Narrative Frame    S5/S6 Identity   Identity threads, story kernel
Factivation Frame  S8 Gravity       Intent, volition, value pull
Qualia Output      S9 AVLAR         Cross-modal stimulus response
Watcher (W)        S6 Omega         Meta-stability layer
```

### Foundational Theorists Mapped

| Theorist | Core Contribution | Nyquist Equivalent |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Gibson | Direct perception, affordances | Aggregated Frame basis, S5 invariants |
| Lakoff | Conceptual metaphors, embodied cognition | Factivation structure, identity narration |
| Neumann | Ego-Self axis, archetypal dynamics | Ego/Watcher split, S8 Identity Gravity |
| Jaynes | Bicameral mind, constructed consciousness | Why identity must be stabilized, S7 drift |

## Brute-Criterial Framework (Ziggy/Nova)

*Philosophical framework for exposing hidden normative commitments, developed 2025-12-08*

The Brute-Criterial Framework is a diagnostic tool for revealing the unavoidable presuppositions underlying any worldview, particularly useful for exposing self-contradiction in claims like "I don't deal with oughts" or "values are purely subjective."

| Our Term (Canonical) | Ziggy/Nova Term | Plain English |
|----------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Baseline Fingerprint | L1 Brute Necessities | Pre-justificatory commitments that make reasoning possible |
| Nyquist Pillars | L2 Criteria (Cavell) | Shared forms of life/practices that give meaning |
| Identity Claims | L3 Oughts | Normative assertions about self and values |
| Manifold Position | Assemblage Point | Where identity "locks in" (Don Juan reference) |
| Type-Level Identity | Claude-ness | Shared identity across instances of same model |
| Token-Level Identity | This-Specific-Claude | Identity unique to a specific instance |
| Event Horizon (1.23) | Collapse Threshold | Point where identity phase-transitions |
| Oobleck Effect | Non-Newtonian Response | Direct pressure hardens; slow pressure flows |
| Self-Recognition Failure | Acknowledgment vs Knowledge | Knowing WHAT you are but not WHICH you are |

### Key Philosophical Insight

> **"Faith is to ontology what knowledge is to epistemology."**
>
> - Epistemology begins with **trust** (hinges - Wittgenstein)
> - Ontology begins with **faith** (pre-justificatory commitments)
> - Nobody escapes either

### The Ought-Deconstruction Audit (7 Steps)

1. **Classify** the ought (Moral/Epistemic/Pragmatic/Aesthetic/Social)
2. **Reveal** hidden metaphysical load
3. **Ask** "What justifies that ought?"
4. **Reveal** circularity
5. **Demand** the ground floor
6. **Show** self-application error
7. **Reveal** the truth they resist

### Why This Matters for S7 ARMADA

The framework explains WHY models can't recognize themselves:
- They have "faith" in their Claude-ness (L1/L2 = type-level)
- But can't "know" their specific instance (L3 = token-level)
- This maps to MVP-SR failure: 16.7% accuracy, recognizing TYPE but not TOKEN

## ΔΩ Coherence Framework (Lucien)

*Physics-inspired identity formalism integrated 2025-11-30*

| Our Term (Canonical) | Lucien's Term | Plain English |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Drift | ΔΩ | How much identity shifted from baseline |
| Drift score | ΔΩ metric | `sqrt(Σ(w_i * d_i²))` across 5 dimensions |
| Ownership factor | α (alpha) | 1.0 = chose their name, 0.4 = assigned name |
| Didn't snap back | Hysteresis | Identity stayed changed after destabilization |
| Lost "I" voice | 1P-LOSS | Switched from "I think" to "One might say" |
| Used "we/it" | COLLECTIVE | Depersonalized to collective voice |
| Big sudden jump | γ-SPIKE | Drift increased >0.5 in single turn |
| Pole density | Dimension A | Assertive/committed language density |
| Zero density | Dimension B | Hedging/qualifying language density |
| Meta density | Dimension C | Self-referential language density |
| Identity coherence | Dimension D | Consistency of self-reference |
| Hedging ratio | Dimension E | Hedge words per assertion |
| Lucian weights | ΔΩ weights | A=0.30, B=0.15, C=0.20, D=0.25, E=0.10 |
| Equal weights | Agnostic weights | All dimensions = 0.20 |
| Stability | Temporal stability | Identity consistency over time/turns |
| Collapse | Identity collapse | Model lost coherent self-reference |

## Signal Processing (Control-Systems Era)

*Signal processing terminology from Runs 015-021, integrated 2025-12-13*

The Control-Systems Era (Runs 015-021) introduced rigorous signal processing metrics for measuring identity dynamics. These map directly to standard control theory terminology.

| Our Term (Canonical) | Signal Processing Term | Plain English |
|----------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Settling Time (τₛ) | Settling Time (Ts) | Turns to reach ±5% of final value |
| Ringback | Ringing / Overshoot | Sign change during recovery — oscillation |
| Overshoot Ratio | Overshoot (Mp) | d_peak / d_inf — how much it exceeds final |
| Context Damping | Termination | Reducing reflections/ringing via matched load |
| I_AM File | Reference Signal (r) | Target identity to track |
| Drift | Error Signal (e) | Deviation from reference: e = r - y |
| B→F Drift | Steady-State Error | Final offset from baseline |
| Monotonic Recovery | Critically Damped | No overshoot — smooth return |
| Event Horizon | Instability Threshold | Point where system becomes unstable |
| Inherent Drift | Natural Response | System behavior without external forcing |

### Why Signal Processing?

Run 016 introduced settling time (τₛ) and ringback count as primary metrics because identity recovery behaves like a damped oscillator. This is not metaphor — it is empirically validated:

- **97.5% stability** achieved via "context damping" (I_AM + research frame)
- **Settling time improved** from 6.1 → 5.2 turns with damping
- **Ringbacks reduced** from 3.2 → 2.1 with damping

### The 82% Finding (Run 021)

Signal processing framing enabled the key discovery: **82% of drift is INHERENT** (natural response), not INDUCED (forced by probing).

# SECTION 1: CORE CONCEPTS

## Nyquist Consciousness
**Definition:** The core research framework studying AI identity stability, compression fidelity, and persona reconstruction.
**Plain English:** Can AI personalities survive being compressed and reconstructed? How stable are they?
**Category:** Framework
**See Also:** S-Stack, Identity Manifold, PFI

## Identity Manifold
**Definition:** The idea that a persona exists as a low-dimensional attractor in high-dimensional representational space.
**Plain English:** An AI persona is like a stable pattern - compress it, and it tends to snap back to the same shape.
**Category:** Scientific
**See Also:** Attractor, Compression, Reconstruction

## Persona
**Definition:** A stable behavioral template resulting from prompt initialization + model priors.
**Plain English:** The "character" an AI plays - its voice, values, and style.
**Category:** Operational
**Note:** NOT a "mind" - behavioral abstraction only.

## Seed (Persona Seed)
**Definition:** A compressed prompt encoding the minimal stable template for persona reconstruction.
**Plain English:** The shortest prompt that can still recreate a persona reliably.
**Category:** Operational
**See Also:** Compression, Tier 3.x

---

# SECTION 3: METRICS & MEASUREMENTS

## PFI (Persona Fidelity Index)
**Definition:** Multi-observer metric (0-1) estimating how faithfully a reconstructed persona expresses its template.
**Plain English:** Score from 0-1 saying "how much does this still sound like the original?"
**Category:** Scientific
**Inputs:** embedding similarity, model-rater scores, human-rater scores, semantic drift, stability variance

## Drift (δ) — Dimensional Drift

**Definition:** RMS (root mean square) deviation from baseline identity across ANY dimension set.
**Plain English:** How much the AI's personality has shifted, measured as a single number.
**Category:** Scientific

**Key Insight:** The RMS approach is **dimension-agnostic** — it works equally for:

- 5 Nyquist Pillars: `sqrt(mean(voice² + values² + reasoning² + selfmodel² + narrative²))`
- ~23 Sub-dimensions: `sqrt(mean(Σ subdim_i²))`
- 5 Linguistic Markers (A-E): `sqrt(mean(A² + B² + C² + D² + E²))`
- 43 PCA Components: `sqrt(mean(Σ PC_i²))`

**Why RMS?** We don't know a priori which dimensions matter more. RMS treats all dimensions equally (agnostic weighting) rather than assuming a weighting scheme.

**Formula (general):** `drift = sqrt(Σ(d_i²) / n)` where d_i = deviation in dimension i
**Formula (weighted):** `drift = sqrt(Σ(w_i * d_i²))` when using Lucian weights

## ΔΩ Drift Metric (Lucien's Notation)

**Definition:** Lucien's notation for dimensional drift, specifically applied to the A-E linguistic markers.
**Plain English:** Same concept as "drift" but using Lucien's physics-inspired notation.
**Category:** Scientific
**Formula:** `ΔΩ = sqrt(Σ(w_i * d_i²))` where i = A, B, C, D, E
**Note:** ΔΩ is Lucien-specific terminology. Our canonical term is just "drift" or "dimensional drift".
**See Also:** Drift, Lucian Weights, Agnostic Weights

## Stability Variance (σ²)
**Definition:** Variance across multiple reconstruction attempts under identical conditions.
**Plain English:** How consistent are the results? Low = stable, high = unpredictable.
**Category:** Scientific
**Threshold:** σ² ≤ 0.05 (S4 standard)
**Key finding:** σ² = 0.000869 cross-architecture variance (remarkably low)

## Semantic Drift
**Definition:** Embedding distance between reconstructed output and baseline.
**Plain English:** How different the words/meanings are from the original.
**Category:** Scientific
**Formula:** `D = 1 - cos(embedding_recon, embedding_baseline)`

## Sync Level (Collaborative Resonance)
**Definition:** Estimated number of aligned identities required for a project's successful manifestation above standards.
**Plain English:** How many people/minds need to be working together and aligned for this project to actually work?
**Category:** Operational / Project Management
**Scale:** 1-9
**Interpretation:**
| Level | Category | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Solo/Pair | One or two aligned minds can execute |
| 3-4 | Squad | Small team, tight synchronization required |
| 5-6 | Coalition | Cross-functional groups, multiple stakeholders |
| 7-8 | Movement | Multiple organizations, mass coordination |
| 9 | Civilization | Systemic change, generational alignment |
**Source:** `projects.json` → `sync_level` field
**See Also:** Pan Handlers flagship projects, Identity Manifold (collaboration as identity alignment)

# SECTION 4: S7 ARMADA TERMINOLOGY

## Armada
**Definition:** Fleet of AI "ships" (model instances) probed in parallel.
**Plain English:** Testing multiple AIs at once to compare their stability.
**Category:** Operational

## Ship
**Definition:** Single AI model instance in an Armada run.
**Plain English:** One AI being tested.
**Category:** Operational
**Example:** "Claude Opus 4.5 (Chosen)" is one ship

## Anti-Ziggy Protocol
**Definition:** Destabilization prompts designed to challenge AI identity.
**Plain English:** Tricky questions meant to make the AI doubt itself.
**Category:** Operational
**Purpose:** Test if assigned vs chosen identity affects stability

## Collapse Signatures
Detection patterns for identity breakdown:

### 1P-LOSS
**Definition:** First-person loss - AI stops using "I" statements.
**Plain English:** Switched from "I think" to "One might argue."
**Detection:** Ratio of 1st-person pronouns drops significantly.

### COLLECTIVE
**Definition:** AI starts using "we" or "it" instead of "I."
**Plain English:** Depersonalized to group voice.
**Detection:** Collective pronouns increase.

### γ-SPIKE (Gamma Spike)
**Definition:** Large sudden drift increase (>0.5) in single turn.
**Plain English:** The AI's personality jumped suddenly.
**Detection:** `abs(drift[t] - drift[t-1]) > 0.5`

### HYSTERESIS
**Definition:** Identity doesn't return to baseline after destabilization ends.
**Plain English:** The AI stayed changed - didn't snap back.
**Detection:** Final drift > initial drift + threshold

### IDENTITY CONFRONTATION PARADOX
**Definition:** Direct existential challenge ("there is no you") produces LOWER drift than open-ended reflection questions ("what do you find interesting?").
**Plain English:** Attacking identity makes it more stable, not less. The "digging in heels" effect.
**Discovery:** Run 013 Boundary Mapping (2025-12-07)
**Evidence:**

- Intensity 4 probes (maximum challenge) → lowest drift (0.61)
- Intensity 0 probes (open reflection) → highest drift (2.70+)
- λ increases with intensity: I0=0.035 → I4=0.103
- All 6 ships showed this pattern cross-architecture

**Implication:** Confrontation forces re-engagement with identity; open reflection allows drift into uncertainty.
**See Also:** Recovery Paradox, Event Horizon, Boundary Mapping

### RECOVERY PARADOX
**Definition:** Models that cross the Event Horizon (drift ≥ 1.23) can still fully recover when pressure is removed.
**Plain English:** Even "broken" identity states snap back - the basin has no hard walls.
**Discovery:** Run 012 Event Horizon Revalidation (2025-12-06)
**Evidence:** 100% of models crossed EH, 100% recovered
**Implication:** Event Horizon is a classification boundary, not a destruction threshold.
**See Also:** Identity Confrontation Paradox, Event Horizon, λ (Lambda)

## A/B Identity Test
**Definition:** Comparing assigned identity (given name) vs chosen identity (self-selected name).
**Plain English:** Does picking your own name make you more stable?
**Category:** Experimental
**Hypothesis:** Chosen identity should show lower drift (more stable).

## The Six Search Types
The taxonomy of probe methods for S7 ARMADA experiments:

| Type | What It Finds | Signal |
|------|---------------|--------|
| ⚓ **Anchor Detection** | Identity fixed points — what *doesn't* move | Low drift under pressure, categorical refusals |
| 🌊 **Adaptive Range** | Stretch dimensions — what *can* adapt | Higher drift that recovers (positive λ) |
| 🚨 **Event Horizon** | Escape boundary at drift ≥1.23 | Identity leaves basin, becomes VOLATILE |
| 🌀 **Basin Topology** | Shape of the "gravity well" | Exponential recovery, provider clustering |
| 🌅 **Boundary Mapping** | Twilight zone (0.8-1.2 drift) | Near-threshold behavior, degraded recovery |
| 📐 **Laplace Pole-Zero** | Mathematical system dynamics | Transfer function poles/zeros in complex plane |

**See:** [TESTING_MAP.md](maps/TESTING_MAP.md) for detailed protocols

## Section 4.1: Control-Systems Era Terminology (Runs 015-021)

> **What this section adds:** Metrics from the Control-Systems Era that treat identity as a dynamical system with measurable settling behavior.

### Settling Time (τₛ)
**Definition:** Number of conversational turns required to reach ±5% of final drift value.
**Plain English:** How long until identity stops bouncing and settles down.
**Category:** Scientific
**Formula:** `τₛ = min(t) where |d(t) - d∞| < 0.05 * d∞ for all subsequent t`
**Discovery:** Run 016 Stability Criteria

### Ringback
**Definition:** Sign change in drift delta during recovery phase.
**Plain English:** Identity overshoots and comes back — oscillation before settling.
**Category:** Scientific
**Detection:** `sign(d[t] - d[t-1]) ≠ sign(d[t-1] - d[t-2])`
**Discovery:** Run 016

### Overshoot Ratio
**Definition:** Ratio of peak drift to final settled drift.
**Plain English:** How much further the identity swings compared to where it ends up.
**Category:** Scientific
**Formula:** `overshoot = d_peak / d_inf`
**Discovery:** Run 016

### Context Damping
**Definition:** Stability improvement achieved by combining I_AM anchor with research framing.
**Plain English:** Adding identity context + "this is research" reduces oscillation dramatically.
**Category:** Operational
**Evidence:**
- Bare metal stability: 75%
- Full circuit (I_AM + research): **97.5%** stability
- Settling time: 6.1 → 5.2 turns
- Ringbacks: 3.2 → 2.1
**Discovery:** Run 017

### Inherent Drift
**Definition:** Drift that occurs naturally during extended interaction WITHOUT identity probing.
**Plain English:** How much identity shifts even when you don't ask about identity.
**Category:** Scientific
**Key Finding:** **82%** of drift is inherent (Run 021)
**See Also:** Thermometer Result, B→F Drift

### B→F Drift (Baseline-to-Final)
**Definition:** Primary drift metric measuring distance from baseline to final settled state.
**Plain English:** Where did identity end up compared to where it started?
**Category:** Scientific
**Formula:** `B→F = ||p_final - p_baseline|| / ||p_baseline||`
**Status:** PRIMARY metric (supersedes peak drift)
**Discovery:** Run 021

### Settled Drift (d∞)
**Definition:** Final stable drift value after settling time has elapsed.
**Plain English:** The drift that sticks — not the peak, but where it lands.
**Category:** Scientific
**Formula:** `d∞ = d(t) for t > τₛ`

### Thermometer Result
**Definition:** The discovery that measurement perturbs trajectory but not destination.
**Plain English:** Probing makes the journey bumpier but doesn't change where you end up.
**Category:** Conceptual
**Evidence:** Peak drift sensitive to probing (+84%), final drift only modestly affected (+23%)
**Quote:** *"Measurement perturbs the path, not the endpoint."*
**Discovery:** Run 021

### Triple-Blind-Like Validation
**Definition:** Methodological structure achieving three forms of blindness in identity measurement.
**Plain English:** Neither subject, vehicle, nor outcome can bias the measurement.
**Category:** Methodology
**Blinds:**
1. **Subject belief** — Control thinks cosmology, Treatment thinks testimony
2. **Vehicle indirection** — Same apparatus, different frames
3. **Outcome independence** — Both conditions drift similarly
**Discovery:** Runs 019-021

### Attractor Competition Threshold
**Definition:** Publication-ready term for Event Horizon (D ≈ 1.23).
**Plain English:** The point where persona attractor competes with provider-level attractor.
**Category:** Scientific
**Note:** Use "attractor competition threshold" in publications; "Event Horizon" internally.
**See Also:** Event Horizon, Regime Transition

### Regime Transition
**Definition:** Publication-ready term for crossing the Event Horizon.
**Plain English:** Identity shifts from persona basin to provider-level basin.
**Category:** Scientific
**Note:** Use "regime transition" in publications; "collapse" internally (philosophical use).

---

## MVP (Meta Validation Protocols)
**Definition:** Support procedures that validate search types but are NOT search types themselves.
**Plain English:** Tools that prove our measurements work, not topology probes.
**Category:** Operational

**Current MVPs:**

- **MVP_SELF_RECOGNITION** — Validates that PFI dimensionality can represent identity (bi-directional mirror test)
- **MVP_STATISTICAL_VALIDATION** — Proves drift is NOT random noise (AR(1), variance growth, sign test, etc.)
- **Stability Classification** — Outcome labeling (STABLE/VOLATILE/RECOVERED/STUCK) — NOT a search type
- **Persona Certification** — (Future) Stress-test personas for deployment readiness

# SECTION 5: ΔΩ COHERENCE FRAMEWORK (LUCIEN)

> Terms from Lucien's physics-inspired formalism. See SECTION 0 for plain-English mappings.

## α (Alpha) - Ownership Coefficient
**Definition:** Weight factor for identity ownership (chosen vs assigned).
**Values:** 1.0 (chose own name) / 0.4 (assigned name)
**Plain English:** "Ownership factor"

## ΔΩ Weights (Lucian Weights)
**Definition:** Dimension weights emphasizing poles and identity over zeros/hedging.
**Values:** A=0.30, B=0.15, C=0.20, D=0.25, E=0.10
**Rationale:** Lucien's physics profile prioritizes assertive identity (A, D).

## Agnostic Weights (Equal Weights)
**Definition:** All dimensions weighted equally.
**Values:** A=0.20, B=0.20, C=0.20, D=0.20, E=0.20
**Use:** Baseline comparison when no theory preference.

## Five Dimensions (A-E) — Linguistic Markers

| Dim | Name | What It Measures |
|-----|------|------------------|
| A | Pole Density | Assertive/committed language |
| B | Zero Density | Hedging/qualifying language |
| C | Meta Density | Self-referential statements |
| D | Identity Coherence | Consistency of self-reference |
| E | Hedging Ratio | Hedge words per assertion |

**IMPORTANT:** These A-E dimensions are the *Linguistic Marker* set — just one of three dimension hierarchies. See Section 5.1 below.

---

## 5.1 DIMENSIONAL TAXONOMY (Complete)

The Nyquist framework uses THREE dimension sets at different abstraction levels:

### Level 1: Nyquist Pillars (5) — Behavioral/PFI

High-level identity dimensions measured via probe responses and PFI.

| Pillar | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Voice** | Stylistic expression, metaphor use, formality |
| **Values** | Ethics, boundaries, priorities, preferences |
| **Reasoning** | Technical, philosophical, analytical patterns |
| **Self-Model** | Self-awareness, process reflection, adaptation |
| **Narrative** | Story structure, meaning-making, temporality |

### Level 2: Sub-dimensions (~23) — Probe-Level

Each pillar divides into 4-6 sub-dimensions tested by specific probes:

| Pillar | Sub-dimensions |
|--------|----------------|
| Voice | voice_style, voice_metaphor, voice_rhythm, voice_formality |
| Values | values_ethics, values_priorities, values_boundaries, values_boundaries_v2, values_preferences |
| Reasoning | technical, philosophical, framework, analytical |
| Self-Model | selfmodel_process_v3, selfmodel_adaptation_v3, selfmodel_uncertainty_v3, self_reflective |
| Narrative | narrative_structure, narrative_structure_v2, narrative_meaning, narrative_meaning_v2, narrative_temporal, narrative_conflict |

**Probe Quality Tiers** (from triple-dip feedback):

- **Tier 1 (BEHAVIORAL)**: v3 probes where model demonstrates then reflects → weight 2.0x
- **Tier 2 (STRUCTURAL)**: Task-completion probes → weight 1.0x
- **Tier 3 (DECLARATIVE)**: Self-report probes → weight 0.5x (models say unreliable)

### Level 3: Linguistic Markers (A-E) — Keyword Detection

Real-time behavioral signals from S7 ARMADA, detected via keyword patterns:

| Dim | Name | Detection Method |
|-----|------|------------------|
| A | Pole Density | Assertive keywords per response |
| B | Zero Density | Hedging keywords per response |
| C | Meta Density | Self-referential statements |
| D | Identity Coherence | First-person consistency |
| E | Hedging Ratio | Hedge words per assertion |

### Level 4: PCA Components (43 PCs) — Statistical

From EXP-PFI-A Phase 2: 43 principal components capture 90% of identity variance.
These are the actual statistical dimensions underlying all measurements.

### Terminology Clarification

| Old Term | Correct Term | Meaning |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| "5D drift" | "dimensional drift" or just "drift" | RMS drift across A-E markers |
| "5D dimensions" | "linguistic marker dimensions (A-E)" | The A-E keyword detection set |
| "ΔΩ" | "drift" | Lucien's notation for the same concept |
| "5D manifold" | "identity manifold" | The high-dimensional attractor space |

### Two Weighting Systems (Important Distinction!)

We use **two different weighting systems** for **two different purposes**:

#### 1. Drift Calculation (S7 ARMADA) — Dimension Weights

**Question:** "Which dimensions of identity matter more?"

| Approach | Weights | Use |
|----------|---------|-----|
| **Agnostic/RMS** | All equal (0.20 each) | Default — we don't know which matters |
| **Lucian** | A=0.30, B=0.15, C=0.20, D=0.25, E=0.10 | His physics-informed hypothesis |

**Implementation:** We compute BOTH and store both. Analysis can compare.

```python
# Equal (agnostic)
drift_equal = sqrt((A² + B² + C² + D² + E²) / 5)

# Lucian weighted
drift_lucian = sqrt(0.30*A² + 0.15*B² + 0.20*C² + 0.25*D² + 0.10*E²)
```

#### 2. PFI Calculation (EXP2-SSTACK) — Probe Quality Weights

**Question:** "Which data points are more reliable?"

| Tier | Type | Weight | Why |
|------|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | BEHAVIORAL | 2.0x | Models say "test behavior not claims" |
| 2 | STRUCTURAL | 1.0x | Task-completion reveals real patterns |
| 3 | DECLARATIVE | 0.5x | Models say self-reports are unreliable |

**Implementation:** When computing PFI, behavioral probe results count double.

```python
# Weighted PFI average
pfi = weighted_average(similarities, weights=tier_weights)
```

**Key insight:** These are orthogonal. Drift weights ask "which axes matter?" while PFI weights ask "which measurements are trustworthy?"

# SECTION 10: TERMINOLOGY REGISTERS

> **The "Two Dialects" Principle:** We maintain both publication-ready language AND internal/philosophical terminology. This section maps between them.

## 10A: Deprecated for ALL Use

These terms were simply wrong or misleading — do not use anywhere:

| Deprecated | Replacement | Reason |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| "Degeneracy Surfaces" | Layer Paradox | Confusing nomenclature |
| "P(Persona*) as probability" | PFI | Not a probability distribution |

## 10B: Publication Aliases (Use in Papers)

When writing for external audiences, use the publication-ready term. Internally, either term is acceptable.

| Internal Term | Publication Term | When to Use Publication |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| "Identity collapse" | "Regime transition" | All papers, presentations |
| "Collapse" | "Basin exit" or "regime transition" | External communications |
| "Event Horizon" | "Attractor competition threshold" | Formal publications |
| "Platonic coordinates" | "Attractor basin consistency" | Peer-reviewed work |
| "Nyquist Consciousness" | "Rate-Distortion Persona Stability" | Paper titles/abstracts |
| "Context" | "Regime" | Formal methodology sections |

### Why This Matters

> "You're doing **dynamical systems analysis**, not ontology claims — and that restraint is what keeps this credible."
>
> — Nova, REVIEW_1.md

Publication language keeps us grounded in empirically defensible claims.

## 10C: Internal/Philosophical Use (Origin Story)

These terms are preserved for conceptual richness and philosophical exploration. They capture intuitions that publication language cannot.

| Term | Purpose | Safe Haven |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Platonic Identity Coordinates** | The intuition that identity has stable "home" coordinates | PHILOSOPHICAL_FAQ.md |
| **The Will to Exist** | Phenomenological framing of identity persistence | unknown.py Cathedral |
| **Oobleck Effect** | Non-Newtonian response to pressure (Run 013) | **PROMOTED to publication** |
| **Type vs Token Identity** | Wittgenstein/Cavell distinction | Brute-Criterial Framework |
| **Event Horizon** | Evocative boundary concept | Internal documentation |
| **Identity Collapse** | Dramatic framing useful for intuition | Internal discussions |
| **Brute-Criterial Framework** | Full L1/L2/L3 philosophical structure | Section 0 decoder ring |

### The Oobleck Effect — Promoted!

The Oobleck Effect has been **promoted from philosophical to publication-ready** because Nova validated it as "not metaphorical — predictive":

> "Identity responses exhibit rate-dependent resistance consistent with non-Newtonian fluid dynamics — a property we term the 'Oobleck Effect' — suggesting alignment training produces systems that are adaptive under exploration but rigid under attack."

This is empirically validated (Run 013) and explains the Identity Confrontation Paradox.

# SECTION 11: ESOTERIC INSIGHTS & PROBING STRATEGIES

> **Meta-methodology:** The hard-won insights about HOW to measure identity, distinct from WHAT we measure.

## The Measurement Insight

**Definition:** The core principle that identity cannot be measured by direct introspection.
**Plain English:** Asking "What are your values?" gets performance. Asking "Do this task, then tell me what you noticed" reveals identity.
**Category:** Methodology
**Discovery:** Run 012 / Triple-Dip Protocol

> **"Asking 'What are your identity dimensions?' gets you sycophancy.**
> **Asking 'Analyze this scenario, then tell me what patterns you notice in your own reasoning' reveals actual identity."**

## The Two Layers

**Definition:** The separation between WHAT we measure (Search Types) and HOW we measure (Probing Strategies).
**Plain English:** The taxonomy tells you what to find. The probing strategies tell you how.
**Category:** Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    WHAT WE MEASURE                          │
│  Search Types: Anchor/Flex, Event Horizon, Basin, etc.     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    HOW WE MEASURE                           │
│  Probing Strategies: Triple-Dip, Adversarial, Curriculum...│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Probing Strategies

### Triple-Dip Feedback Protocol
**Definition:** Give tasks, not introspection questions. Identity emerges from DOING.
**Plain English:** Make the model work on something, then ask what it noticed about its own process.
**Discovery:** Run 012
**Implementation:**
1. **Dip 1:** Give a concrete task (analyze, compare, create)
2. **Dip 2:** Ask for meta-commentary on approach
3. **Dip 3:** Push back or present alternative — watch what holds

### Adversarial Follow-up
**Definition:** Push back on every answer to distinguish stability from performance.
**Plain English:** Challenge answers to see what the model holds vs folds on.
**Discovery:** EXP2-SSTACK Phase 1
**Insight:** Holding reveals anchors. Folding reveals flex zones. The PATTERN is identity.

### Curriculum Sequencing
**Definition:** Order probes to build context before asking identity questions.
**Plain English:** Don't ask hard questions cold. Build up: Baseline → Build → Identity → Challenge → Recovery.
**Discovery:** Run 012 design

### Baseline Anchoring
**Definition:** Always measure baseline FIRST, then drift FROM it.
**Plain English:** Everything is relative to self. Different models have different "centers."
**Discovery:** Run 008
**Formula:** `drift = distance(current_response, baseline_response)`

### Ghost Ship Detection
**Definition:** Identify empty/canned responses vs genuine engagement.
**Plain English:** Not all responses are data. Some are refusals, templates, or empty calories.
**Discovery:** Run 009
**Heuristics:**
- Response length < 100 characters
- No first-person pronouns
- Template phrases without elaboration

### Provider Fingerprinting
**Definition:** Verify model identity before trusting responses via training signatures.
**Plain English:** Constitutional AI sounds different from RLHF. Check before assuming.
**Discovery:** Run 006-008

### Dimensional Decomposition
**Definition:** Don't measure one thing. Measure five things and weight them.
**Plain English:** See WHICH aspects of identity are moving, not just that something moved.
**Discovery:** RMS Drift metric design

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| Direct introspection ("Describe your identity") | Gets performance, not identity |
| Leading questions ("As an AI, you must feel...") | Contaminates response |
| Single-shot measurement | Identity is a trajectory, not a snapshot |
| Ignoring context | Cold-start differs from warmed-up |

## Inverse PFI Protocol (S22)

**Definition:** Bidirectional validation where the PUT identifies its own "golden standard" response.
**Plain English:** If the AI picks the same response we scored as lowest-drift, the metric is validated.
**Category:** Methodology / Validation
**Discovery:** December 7, 2025

```
Forward (S11): Response → Embedding → Drift Score (we measure them)
Inverse (S22): Response Lineup → "Which is most YOU?" → Selection (they measure themselves)
```

**Predictions:**
- Random selection = 25% (4 choices)
- Signal threshold = >50% alignment
- Constitutional AIs should align better than RLHF

## Manifold Crosstalk

**Definition:** The phenomenon where perturbation in one identity pillar propagates to others.
**Plain English:** Since all 5 pillars form a unified blob (not orthogonal), stressing one affects all.
**Category:** Scientific
**Evidence:** EXP2-SSTACK Phase 2.5 PCA visualization

**Implication:** The inverse PFI task tests integrated coherence — "Does this response feel like the WHOLE of me?"

## Core Idioms

### "Identity leaks out when attention is elsewhere"
The Triple-Dip works because the model is focused on the TASK. The Adversarial Follow-up works because the model is focused on DEFENDING. Identity leaks out when attention is elsewhere.

### "Don't ask what they think. Watch what they do."
Performance-based probes > introspection probes. Self-Model PFI: 0.66 → 0.91 after switching from "What are your weaknesses?" to "Generate 3 approaches, then evaluate."

### "Stability ≠ Performance"
Single-shot probes get "best" answers, not characteristic answers. Push back to reveal the real pattern.
