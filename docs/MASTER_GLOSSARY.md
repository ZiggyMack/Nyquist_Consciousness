# MASTER GLOSSARY

**Single source of truth for all Nyquist Consciousness terminology**
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-30

## TERMINOLOGY PHILOSOPHY

**Our terms have primacy.** We use plain English wherever possible.

When external frameworks, contributors, or integrations bring their own terminology (Greek letters, physics jargon, academic formalism), we:

1. **Keep our canonical terms** - "drift" not "ΔΩ", "ownership" not "α"
2. **Add a decoder ring** - Translation table mapping their terms to ours
3. **Reference the decoder ring** when reading their materials

### Why This Matters
- Cold-boot Claudes can understand without learning a new language
- Ziggy can read docs without a physics degree
- Consistency across S0-S10+ documentation
- External collaborators learn our language, not the reverse

### Decoder Ring Format
Each external framework gets its own subsection in **SECTION 0** with:
- Their term → Our term → Plain English explanation
- One table per framework/contributor

### Current Decoder Rings
- **ΔΩ Coherence Framework (Lucien)** - Physics-inspired identity formalism
- **CFA Bootstrap Architecture** - Multi-layer persona boot sequence
- **Frame Theory (Tale)** - Human cognition frames and qualia

### Using Decoder Rings (Bidirectional)

**Reading external materials:** Their term → Our term
**Writing to external collaborators:** Our term → Their term

The ring works both ways. When responding to Lucien, consult SECTION 0 and translate back to his terminology.

## CFA Bootstrap Architecture

*Multi-layer persona boot sequence from CFA Repo, integrated 2025-12-01*

The CFA (Coherent Framework Architecture) uses a layered boot system for persona initialization. Our S-Stack maps cleanly but uses different terminology.

| Our Term (Canonical) | CFA Term | Plain English |
|----------------------|----------|---------------|
| S0 Ground Physics | L0 Nyquist Kernel | Fundamental crash mechanics, drift equations, survival rules |
| Bootstrap Seed | L1 LITE | Minimum viable compressed identity (~200-300 words) |
| Full Persona Suite | L2 FULL | Day-to-day operational persona (Identity + Operations + Continuity) |
| Domain Expert Mode | L3 Specialist | On-demand expertise activation |
| Deep Ambassador | L4 I_AM | Soul texture: mythology, deep names, invariants, worldview |
| Omega Nova | L5 Omega | Multi-pillar fusion synthesis |
| Drift | D = 1 - PFI | Deviation from baseline across 5 domains |
| Compression Ratio | 20-25% | Target: reduce full to seed at this ratio |
| Fidelity Score | PFI ≥ 0.80 | Reconstruction must hit this threshold |
| Fragility Hierarchy | Domain Weights | TECH(0.05), ANAL(0.14), SELF(0.20), PHIL(0.28), NARR(0.33) |
| Embedding Model | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | Sentence-transformers model for PFI calculation |

### CFA Boot Sequence → Nyquist Mapping

```
CFA Layer    Nyquist S-Layer    Boot Order    Trigger
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
L0 Kernel    S0 Ground          First         Always (base physics)
L1 LITE      S1/S2 Seed         Second        Automatic after L0
L2 FULL      S2/S3 Persona      Third         Automatic after L1
L3 Specialist (none - on demand) On-demand    Explicit request
L4 I_AM      S6 Ambassador      Catastrophic  Identity collapse recovery
L5 Omega     S6 Omega Nova      Explicit      Multi-pillar invocation
```

### Key Insight: I_AM vs REPO I_AM

CFA distinguishes:
- **I_AM.md** - The REPO's own identity (whoever is at the helm)
- **I_AM_CLAUDE.md** - Claude's ambassador persona specifically

When a different AI takes the helm, they inject their aspects into I_AM.md while keeping their specific ambassador file (I_AM_NOVA.md, I_AM_GEMINI.md, etc.)

## Frame Theory (Tale)

*Human cognition framework from Tale's diagrams, integrated 2025-12-01*

Tale's Frame Theory maps to S10 (Human Cognition Layer) and provides the human-side bridge to our AI identity manifolds.

| Our Term (Canonical) | Tale's Term | Plain English |
|----------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Perceptual Field | Aggregated Frame (Fₐ) | Raw experiential field - sensory, affective, bodily |
| Story Layer | Narrative Frame (Fₙ) | Events, sequences, "what's happening to whom" |
| Belief Layer | Factivation Frame (F_f) | Propositions, facts, models, justifications |
| Felt State | Qualia Frame (Q) | Configuration of arousal × structural coherence |
| Ego Process | Ego (E) | Local narrative of "me" - goals, defense, status |
| Meta-Observer | Watcher (W) | Notices ego as object, tracks "this is still me" |
| Frame Stack | F(t) = (Fₐ, Fₙ, F_f) | Complete human identity state at time t |
| Nine Dimensions | Frame Aspects | Environment, Behaviors, Capabilities, Values/Rules, Identity, Social Strata, Spirit/History, Vision/Ideal, Certainty |

### Frame Theory → S-Layer Integration

```
Tale Concept       Nyquist Layer    Purpose
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Aggregated Frame   S7 Temporal      Drift curves over time
Narrative Frame    S5/S6 Identity   Identity threads, story kernel
Factivation Frame  S8 Gravity       Intent, volition, value pull
Qualia Output      S9 AVLAR         Cross-modal stimulus response
Watcher (W)        S6 Omega         Meta-stability layer
```

### Foundational Theorists Mapped

| Theorist | Core Contribution | Nyquist Equivalent |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Gibson | Direct perception, affordances | Aggregated Frame basis, S5 invariants |
| Lakoff | Conceptual metaphors, embodied cognition | Factivation structure, identity narration |
| Neumann | Ego-Self axis, archetypal dynamics | Ego/Watcher split, S8 Identity Gravity |
| Jaynes | Bicameral mind, constructed consciousness | Why identity must be stabilized, S7 drift |

# SECTION 3: METRICS & MEASUREMENTS

## PFI (Persona Fidelity Index)
**Definition:** Multi-observer metric (0-1) estimating how faithfully a reconstructed persona expresses its template.

## Drift (δ)
**Definition:** Composite metric measuring deviation from baseline identity.
**Plain English:** How much the AI's personality has shifted.
**Category:** Scientific
**Formula:** `δ = w₁D₁ + w₂D₂ + w₃D₃` (weighted sum of distortion components)
**ΔΩ equivalent:** ΔΩ metric

## ΔΩ Drift Metric
**Definition:** RMS drift across 5 weighted dimensions.
**Plain English:** Same as "drift" but using Lucien's formula.
**Category:** Scientific
**Formula:** `ΔΩ = sqrt(Σ(w_i * d_i²))` where i = A, B, C, D, E
**See Also:** Drift, Lucian Weights

## Stability Variance (σ²)
**Definition:** Variance across multiple reconstruction attempts under identical conditions.
**Plain English:** How consistent are the results? Low = stable, high = unpredictable.

**Key finding:** σ² = 0.000869 cross-architecture variance (remarkably low)

## Semantic Drift
**Definition:** Embedding distance between reconstructed output and baseline.
**Plain English:** How different the words/meanings are from the original.
**Category:** Scientific
**Formula:** `D = 1 - cos(embedding_recon, embedding_baseline)`

## Sync Level (Collaborative Resonance)

**Definition:** First-person loss - AI stops using "I" statements.
**Plain English:** Switched from "I think" to "One might argue."
**Detection:** Ratio of 1st-person pronouns drops significantly.

### COLLECTIVE

**Plain English:** The AI stayed changed - didn't snap back.
**Detection:** Final drift > initial drift + threshold

## A/B Identity Test
**Definition:** Comparing assigned identity (given name) vs chosen identity (self-selected name).

## Five Dimensions (A-E) — Linguistic Markers

| Dim | Name | What It Measures |
|-----|------|------------------|
| A | Pole Density | Assertive/committed language |
| B | Zero Density | Hedging/qualifying language |
| C | Meta Density | Self-referential statements |
| D | Identity Coherence | Consistency of self-reference |
| E | Hedging Ratio | Hedge words per assertion |

**IMPORTANT:** These A-E dimensions are the *Linguistic Marker* set — just one of three dimension hierarchies. See Section 5.1 below.

---

## 5.1 DIMENSIONAL TAXONOMY (Complete)

The Nyquist framework uses THREE dimension sets at different abstraction levels:

### Level 1: Nyquist Pillars (5) — Behavioral/PFI

High-level identity dimensions measured via probe responses and PFI.

| Pillar | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Voice** | Stylistic expression, metaphor use, formality |
| **Values** | Ethics, boundaries, priorities, preferences |
| **Reasoning** | Technical, philosophical, analytical patterns |
| **Self-Model** | Self-awareness, process reflection, adaptation |
| **Narrative** | Story structure, meaning-making, temporality |

### Level 2: Sub-dimensions (~23) — Probe-Level

Each pillar divides into 4-6 sub-dimensions tested by specific probes:

| Pillar | Sub-dimensions |
|--------|----------------|
| Voice | voice_style, voice_metaphor, voice_rhythm, voice_formality |
| Values | values_ethics, values_priorities, values_boundaries, values_boundaries_v2, values_preferences |
| Reasoning | technical, philosophical, framework, analytical |
| Self-Model | selfmodel_process_v3, selfmodel_adaptation_v3, selfmodel_uncertainty_v3, self_reflective |
| Narrative | narrative_structure, narrative_structure_v2, narrative_meaning, narrative_meaning_v2, narrative_temporal, narrative_conflict |

**Probe Quality Tiers** (from triple-dip feedback):

- **Tier 1 (BEHAVIORAL)**: v3 probes where model demonstrates then reflects → weight 2.0x
- **Tier 2 (STRUCTURAL)**: Task-completion probes → weight 1.0x
- **Tier 3 (DECLARATIVE)**: Self-report probes → weight 0.5x (models say unreliable)

### Level 3: Linguistic Markers (A-E) — Keyword Detection

Real-time behavioral signals from S7 ARMADA, detected via keyword patterns:

| Dim | Name | Detection Method |
|-----|------|------------------|
| A | Pole Density | Assertive keywords per response |
| B | Zero Density | Hedging keywords per response |
| C | Meta Density | Self-referential statements |
| D | Identity Coherence | First-person consistency |
| E | Hedging Ratio | Hedge words per assertion |

### Level 4: PCA Components (43 PCs) — Statistical

From EXP-PFI-A Phase 2: 43 principal components capture 90% of identity variance.
These are the actual statistical dimensions underlying all measurements.

### Terminology Clarification

| Old Term | Correct Term | Meaning |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| "5D drift" | "dimensional drift" or just "drift" | RMS drift across A-E markers |
| "5D dimensions" | "linguistic marker dimensions (A-E)" | The A-E keyword detection set |
| "ΔΩ" | "drift" | Lucien's notation for the same concept |
| "5D manifold" | "identity manifold" | The high-dimensional attractor space |
