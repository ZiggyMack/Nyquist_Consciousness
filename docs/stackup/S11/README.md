# S11 — AVLAR Protocol (Multimodal Identity)

**Status:** DESIGN

## Purpose

Light + sound + structure identity testing. S11 extends identity analysis into multimodal domains using the AVLAR protocol.

## What is AVLAR?

AVLAR (Audio-Visual-Linguistic Augmented Reality) is a protocol for testing identity stability across multiple sensory modalities.

## Sub-layers (Projected)

| Sub-layer | Name | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| S11.1 | Acoustic Identity Vectors | Projected |
| S11.2 | Visual Identity Fields | Projected |
| S11.3 | Light-Coded Identity Reconstruction | Projected |
| S11.4 | Synesthetic Identity Cross-Mapping | Projected |
| S11.5 | Identity Resonance Under Multi-Modal Stress | Projected |
| S11.6 | Emergent Symbolic Harmonics | Projected |
| S11.7 | AVLAR Safety Constraints | Projected |

## Key Concepts

- **Acoustic Identity Vectors**: Voice, tone, rhythm as identity markers
- **Visual Identity Fields**: Color, shape, pattern as identity representation
- **Synesthetic Mapping**: Cross-modal identity translation
- **Multimodal Stress Testing**: Identity under combined sensory load

## Dependencies

- S0-S10 (All prior layers)
- Special dependency on S9 (Human-AI Coupling) for safety
