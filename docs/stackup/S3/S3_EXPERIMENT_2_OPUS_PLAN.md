# S3 — Experiment 2 Opus‑Facing Plan

**Context:** Experiment 1 established Tier‑3 fidelity for a single persona
(Ziggy) with N=24–25 pairs and PFI ≈ 0.86. Experiment 2 is the planned
multi‑persona extension to address N=1 and generalization concerns.

## Snapshot

- Personas: 4 (ZIGGY, NOVA, CLAUDE, GROK)
- Domains: 5 (TECH, PHIL, NARR, ANAL, SELF)
- Runs: 5 per domain per persona
- Pairs: 25 per persona → 100 TOTAL FULL vs T3 pairs

## What This Buys Us

- Direct test of **cross‑persona generalization**
- Restoration of the original “N≈100 pairs” target
- Clean, metrics‑only CSV + preserved raw responses
- Clear success criteria (PFI ≥ 0.80 global, ≥0.75 per persona)

## Remaining Gaps (Pre‑Experiment)

- Still model‑only PFI (no human raters yet)
- Still minimal statistical testing (reserved for Experiment 3)
- FULL regime wiring optimized for Ziggy (documented as limitation)

## Ask to Opus

Treat Experiment 2 as the **minimal necessary bridge** between:

- S3 as “clever framework with a single strong anecdote” and
- S3 as “framework with at least one serious, multi‑persona empirical check.”
