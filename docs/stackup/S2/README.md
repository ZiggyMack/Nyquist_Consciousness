# S2 — Integrity & Logics

**Status:** FROZEN
**Also Known As:** Reconstruction Framework, Prompting/Scaffolding

## Purpose

Consistency, operational rules, and error boundaries. S2 defines how compressed identities are reconstructed across different AI architectures.

## Reconstruction Operator

```text
Rᵃ(T) → P′
```

Where:

- `a` = architecture ∈ {Nova, Claude, Grok, Gemini}
- `P′` = reconstructed persona (notation frozen as P′, not P̂)

## Safety Constraints (IMMUTABLE)

| Threshold | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Safety | D ≤ 0.20 | Normal operational drift limit |
| Catastrophic | D ≤ 0.80 | Maximum before collapse |

## Key Invariants

- Drift must remain within safety threshold
- No catastrophic collapse permitted
- Reconstruction must be deterministic given same inputs

## Dependencies

- S0 (Ground Physics)
- S1 (Bootstrap Architecture)

## Integration Points

See [S_Series_README.md](../S_Series_README.md) for the complete S-layer navigation map.
