**A Quality Control Checklist for Research Programs**

## Quick Reference

| Stone | Function | Question to Ask |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 🟡 Mind | Methodology | Is the research protected from contamination? |
| 🟣 Power | Scale | Is there sufficient statistical power? |
| 🔴 Reality | Measurement | Is there a concrete quantification mechanism? |
| 🟠 Soul | Validity | Can you prove you're measuring, not creating? |
| 🔵 Space | Generalization | Does it work beyond one system/context? |
| 🟢 Time | Temporal | Are thresholds and dynamics characterized? |

## Interpretation Guide

| Score | Status | Implication |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 12/12 | Complete Gauntlet | Full research capability |
| 10-11 | Near Complete | One stone weak - address before publication |
| 7-9 | Partial | Multiple gaps - not ready for strong claims |
| 4-6 | Incomplete | Major methodology gaps |
| 0-3 | Critical | Fundamental redesign needed |

---

## Failure Mode Reference

| Missing Stone | What Happens |
|---------------|--------------|
| 🟡 Mind | You're measuring artifacts, not phenomena |
| 🟣 Power | Findings are anecdotal, not generalizable |
| 🔴 Reality | No quantification—"what do numbers mean?" |
| 🟠 Soul | Can't prove validity—"maybe you created it" |
| 🔵 Space | Local findings only—unknown if generalizes |
| 🟢 Time | No thresholds—"when does it matter?" |

---

## Usage Notes

### For New Projects
Run this audit during design phase. Identify missing stones BEFORE data collection.

### For Ongoing Research
Run periodically (e.g., each milestone). Track which stones strengthen over time.

### For Publication Review
All stones should score 2/2 before submitting strong claims.

### For Cross-Pollination
Use weak stones to prioritize which other projects to consult.

## LLM Book Integration

This audit can be applied to any project in the registry:

```
py 3_burp.py --audit Infinity  # Future: automated stone scoring
```

Current manual process:
1. Read project's _ROUND_N/ analysis
2. Score each stone
3. Record in registry (future: stone_scores field)
4. Use gaps to prioritize cross-pollination questions
