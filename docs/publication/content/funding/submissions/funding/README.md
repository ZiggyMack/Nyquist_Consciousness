## Proposal Structure

### Abstract (250 words)

The Nyquist Consciousness Framework provides the first empirical methodology for measuring and predicting AI identity stability. Phase 1 (complete) validated core claims across 5 AI providers with σ² = 0.000869 cross-architecture variance. Phase 2 seeks funding to expand validation to 20+ platforms and develop standardized testing protocols.

### Specific Aims

**Aim 1:** Expand cross-platform validation (10 → 20+ providers)
- Test generalizability across architecture families
- Calibrate Event Horizon thresholds per platform

**Aim 2:** Develop standardized stability testing framework
- Open-source measurement tools
- Replicable protocols
- Benchmark datasets

**Aim 3:** Establish theoretical foundations
- Mathematical formalization of stability dynamics
- Connection to control systems theory
- Publication in peer-reviewed venues

### Budget Overview (Phase 2: 3 Years)

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Personnel | $120K | $130K | $140K | $390K |
| API Costs | $30K | $40K | $30K | $100K |
| Computing | $15K | $15K | $10K | $40K |
| Travel | $10K | $10K | $10K | $30K |
| Other | $10K | $10K | $10K | $30K |
| **Total** | **$185K** | **$205K** | **$200K** | **$590K** |

### Preliminary Results

- **21 experimental runs** completed
- **54 AI configurations** tested
- **184 consolidated data files** from Run 018 IRON CLAD
- **82% inherent drift** confirmed (not measurement artifact)
- **Cross-provider validation:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Together

## Key Differentiators

### Novel Contributions

1. **First empirical measurement** of AI identity stability
2. **Cross-architecture validation** (transformer variants, MoE, etc.)
3. **Practical stability metrics** for industry adoption
4. **Theoretical bridge** to control systems and cognitive science

### Broader Impact

- AI Safety: Predictable AI behavior
- Industry: Stability testing protocols
- Research: New measurement paradigm
- Policy: Evidence-based AI governance
