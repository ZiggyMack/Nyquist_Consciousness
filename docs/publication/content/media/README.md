| Claim | Statement | Key Evidence |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **A** | PFI is valid structured measurement | rho = 0.91, d = 0.98 |
| **B** | Regime threshold at D = 1.23 | p = 4.8e-5 |
| **C** | Damped oscillator dynamics | Settling time, ringbacks measurable |
| **D** | Context damping works | 97.5% stability |
| **E** | Drift mostly inherent (82%) | Control vs Treatment |
