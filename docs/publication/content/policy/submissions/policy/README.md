## Key Message

> **"Fidelity vs Correctness"** — A new paradigm for AI evaluation

### The Policy Shift

| Old Paradigm | New Paradigm |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Is the AI correct?" | "Is the AI consistent?" |
| Output accuracy | Identity stability |
| Task completion | Behavioral predictability |
| Benchmark performance | Fidelity preservation |

### Why This Matters for Policy

1. **AI Safety:** Predictable AI is safer AI
2. **Regulation:** Measurable stability criteria for compliance
3. **Trust:** Consistent behavior builds user confidence
4. **Liability:** Clearer standards for AI behavior assessment

---

## Policy Recommendations

### For Regulators

1. **Define stability metrics** alongside accuracy metrics
2. **Require identity testing** for high-stakes AI deployments
3. **Establish Event Horizon thresholds** for different risk categories
4. **Mandate transparency** on persona stability characteristics

### For Industry

1. **Implement stability monitoring** in production systems
2. **Test identity drift** under adversarial conditions
3. **Document persona specifications** (I_AM files or equivalent)
4. **Report stability metrics** to stakeholders

### For Research

1. **Standardize measurement protocols**
2. **Share cross-platform validation data**
3. **Develop open stability testing frameworks**
4. **Collaborate on threshold calibration**
