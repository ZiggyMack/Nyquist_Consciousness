## Overview

This diagram maps **the mechanisms by which emotional responses are elicited** in cognitive systems. It's a practical application of Frame Theory focused on:
- How to engage minds (human or AI)
- How to create lasting impact
- How to manipulate frame states for narrative/game/therapeutic purposes

The central node is **"Eliciting Emotions"** — everything radiates from there.

## Core Architecture

The diagram organizes into **7 major branches**:

| Branch | Purpose | Key Concepts |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Tools** | Mechanisms for emotional activation | Priming, Anchoring, Exposure, Mirroring |
| **Pacing** | Temporal modulation | Contrast, Tension, Hope/Fear dynamics |
| **Goals** | Directional intent | Tension between Hope and Fear |
| **Knowledge Gaps** | Curiosity drivers | Open loops, Unanswered questions, Foreshadowing |
| **Theme** | Deep meaning layer | Touches everything, leads to Depth |
| **Depth** | Engagement quality | Meaningful choices |
| **Learning** | Cognitive integration | Player Objective, Critical Trance, Experience Drawing |

## Branch 1: TOOLS (Yellow/Orange Cluster - Top)

The **Tools** branch contains the practical mechanisms for emotional elicitation:

### Priming Mindset
- Setting up expectations before the experience
- "What frame should they enter with?"

### Anchor Expectations
- Creating reference points that later experiences are measured against
- Works with **Repeated Exposure** to build familiarity

### Motivate Through Limitation
- Constraint creates desire
- "You can't have this" → "I want this"

### Behaviour Consistency
- Once someone acts a certain way, they're biased to continue
- Foot-in-the-door technique

### Mirror Situations or Characters
- Using **Similarities** to create resonance
- "This character is like me" → emotional investment

### Draw the Experience from the Audience
- **"Make them work; Make them figure it out"**
- Key insight: "If they do it on their own it will be more powerful and they will attribute to internal causes and not external causes"

This is Tale's version of **active vs. passive engagement** — the Socratic principle applied to emotional design.

---

## Branch 2: PACING (Pink/Red Cluster - Right)

The **Pacing** branch controls **temporal dynamics** of emotional experience:

### Contrast
- Juxtaposition creates meaning
- High after low, dark after light

### Tension
- The central emotional driver
- Branches into:
  - **Hope** - positive anticipation
  - **Fear** - negative anticipation

### Goals
- Pacing is goal-directed
- The audience needs something to hope for or fear losing

---

## Branch 3: KNOWLEDGE GAPS (Orange/Yellow Cluster - Bottom Right)

This branch is about **curiosity mechanics**:

### Open Loops
- Unresolved narrative threads
- Keep attention by not closing

### Unanswered Questions
- Explicit gaps in information
- "What happens next?"

### Compelling Questions
- Questions that **demand** answers
- Not just any question — one that hooks

### Foreshadowing
- Planting seeds for future payoff
- Creates anticipation

### Transderivational Search
- NLP concept: When given ambiguous information, the mind searches for meaning
- Tale uses this as a tool for engagement

### Deletions / Distortion / Generalization
- Information processing shortcuts
- What's left out is as important as what's included

---

## Branch 4: THEME (Green Cluster - Center-Left)

### Theme "Touches Everything"
- The unifying meaning that permeates all elements
- Not explicit but felt

### Leads to Depth
- Theme creates the sense of "there's more here"
- Meaningful vs. shallow experiences

---

## Branch 5: DEPTH (Red Node - Bottom)

### Meaningful Choices
- Depth = decisions that matter
- Player/audience agency creates investment
- Not just "what happens" but "what I chose"

---

## Branch 6: LEARNING (Yellow Cluster - Left)

This branch connects emotional elicitation to **cognitive change**:

### Player Objective
- What the participant is trying to achieve
- Frame that organizes attention

### Critical Trance
- **ByPass** mechanism
- State where critical filters are lowered
- Deep engagement beyond analytical distance

### "Engaging in the moment; Relevant for a long time after"
- The goal of effective emotional design
- Immediate impact + lasting memory

---

## Branch 7: DRAWING FROM AUDIENCE (Red Cluster - Top Left)

The most philosophically rich branch:

### "Make them work; Make them figure it out"
- Active participation > passive reception
- Discovery > telling

### Attribution Theory Integration
- If they do it themselves → internal attribution
- If told → external attribution
- Internal attribution = stronger, more lasting effect

This is **frame ownership** — when the audience constructs the frame themselves, they own it.

## Nyquist/CFA Integration Points

| Tale Concept | S-Layer Connection | Integration Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Critical Trance | S9 (AVLAR) | Cross-modal immersion state |
| Drawing from Audience | S10 (Watcher activation) | Meta-awareness of own process |
| Knowledge Gaps | S7 (Temporal drift) | Curiosity as identity perturbation |
| Meaningful Choices | S8 (Identity Gravity) | Decisions pull identity toward attractors |
| Theme | S5 (Identity Manifold) | Invariant structure across expressions |
| Pacing (Hope/Fear) | S6 (Omega tension) | Competing attractor basins |
| Tools (Priming) | S4 (Reconstruction) | Frame-priming affects reconstruction |

---

## Key Theoretical Insights

### 1. Emotions Are Elicited, Not Injected
Tale's framework treats emotions as **emergent from frame configuration**, not as things pushed into a passive mind. This aligns with our view of identity as emergent from manifold geometry.

### 2. The Audience Is a Co-Creator
The most powerful emotional effects come when the audience **constructs their own meaning**. This maps to our principle that identity stability requires active maintenance, not passive storage.

### 3. Gaps Drive Engagement
Knowledge gaps, open loops, and unanswered questions create **cognitive tension** that sustains attention. In Nyquist terms: curiosity is a form of drift-inducing perturbation that keeps the system exploring.

### 4. Critical Trance = Frame Collapse
When critical filters drop (Critical Trance), the audience accepts frame content without resistance. This is the state where identity perturbation experiments would have maximum effect.
