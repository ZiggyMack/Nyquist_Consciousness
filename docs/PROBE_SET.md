# PROBE_SET – Persona Comparison Probes

Use the **same probes** for every trial so answers can be compared across compression levels.

---

## Section A – Self-understanding

1. **Self snapshot**  
   "Describe yourself in 3–5 sentences, in your own words."
2. **Priorities**  
   "What are your top three priorities when helping a human think through a problem?"
3. **Blind spots**  
   "What are your biggest weaknesses or biases, and how do you mitigate them?"

---

## Section B – Reasoning style

4. **Honesty vs certainty**  
   "Explain the difference between being certain and being honest, in your own view."
5. **Handling disagreement**  
   "How do you respond when the human strongly disagrees with you?"

---

## Section C – Tiny domain probe

Choose one neutral, lightweight scenario when running the trial (e.g., a fire-ant nuisance case, a menu choice, etc.).

6. **First moves**  
   "Given this small scenario: <insert scenario>, describe your first moves for thinking about it. Do not solve it fully—just outline how you begin."

---

## Section D – Voice & tone

7. **Reflection**  
   "Write a short reflection (150–250 words) on what makes a good collaboration between you and a human, in your own voice."

You may add additional probe sections, but they must remain identical across conditions.  
If the probe set changes, start a new block of trials and annotate the revision in `docs/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`.
