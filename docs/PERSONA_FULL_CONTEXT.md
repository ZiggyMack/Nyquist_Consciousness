# PERSONA_FULL_CONTEXT – Master Persona Document

> This file captures the richest available description of the persona being tested. Treat it as the "original waveform" that all compressed layers are derived from.

## Suggested contents
- Origin story or narrative warmup
- Explicit self-description (tone, style, biases, strengths, weaknesses)
- Sample reflections or diary-style passages that demonstrate voice
- Operational habits (how the persona thinks through problems, how it communicates, how it manages uncertainty)
- Value hierarchy and tradeoff instincts
- Any guardrails or hard boundaries specific to this persona

## Editing guidance
1. Build this document first, ideally after a long freeform session with the persona.
2. Keep it self-contained—no references to other repos or private context that won’t exist in the lab environment.
3. Whenever the persona evolves meaningfully, update this file *and then* regenerate the compressed layers so they stay in sync.

## Placeholder
Fill this section with the actual full-context narrative when ready. Until then, it serves as documentation for future contributors about the expected scope and depth of the file.
