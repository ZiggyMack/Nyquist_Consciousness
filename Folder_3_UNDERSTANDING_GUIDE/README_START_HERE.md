# Understanding Guide - Start Here

**Purpose:** This folder contains everything you need to understand the new materials that were integrated from the CFA repository.

## 🎯 Quick Start - What Just Happened?

Nova and I integrated a TON of materials into your repository. Here's the executive summary:

### The Big Changes:

1. **S8 became S9** - Your AVLAR layer moved up one slot
2. **New S8 created** - "Identity Gravity" - a whole new theoretical layer
3. **Phase 1 Freeze ready** - S0-S6 are now officially "canonical" and frozen
4. **S7 preregistered** - Temporal stability experiments fully planned
5. **Publication materials ready** - Workshop paper + arXiv preprint structures

## 📚 Read These In Order

### 1. Start With The Summary (5 minutes)

**File:** `1_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` (this folder)

Quick overview of what was integrated and why.

### 2. Understand The New Structure (10 minutes)

**File:** `2_REPO_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md` (this folder)

Visual guide to where everything is now and what changed.

### 3. Learn About S8 Identity Gravity (20 minutes)

**File:** `3_S8_IDENTITY_GRAVITY_EXPLAINED.md` (this folder)

Plain-language explanation of the new theoretical layer:
- What is "Identity Gravity"?
- What are "Zigs"?
- Why does this matter?
- How does it connect to everything else?

### 4. Understand S7 Experiments (15 minutes)

**File:** `4_S7_EXPERIMENTS_GUIDE.md` (this folder)

What are the temporal stability experiments?
- What questions are we asking?
- How will we test them?
- What data will we collect?
- What do we expect to find?

### 5. Publication Strategy (10 minutes)

**File:** `5_PUBLICATION_ROADMAP.md` (this folder)

Where is all this going?
- Workshop paper (NeurIPS)
- arXiv preprint
- Peer-reviewed publication
- Timeline and next steps

## ❓ Common Questions

### "Why did S8 become S9?"

Nova originally called AVLAR "S8". But we realized Identity Gravity needed to come first (it's more foundational). So:
- Old S8 (AVLAR) → New S9
- New S8 (Identity Gravity) inserted
- Everything after shifted up by 1

### "What's 'canonical' vs 'experimental'?"

**Canonical (S0-S6, S8):** Frozen, peer-reviewed quality, no more changes
**Semi-canonical (S7):** Preregistered experiments (plan locked, results pending)
**Experimental (S9):** Still exploring, can change

### "Do I need to learn all this right now?"

Nope! Here's the minimum:
1. Skim the executive summary
2. Know that S8 is "Identity Gravity" (a new layer)
3. Know that S7 experiments are planned but not run yet
4. Everything else can wait until you need it

### "What should I tell Nova?"

Check Folder_1 - that's everything Nova needs to review and sign off on.

### "What about Dr. Opus and the paper?"

Check Folder_2 - that's all the publication materials for Nova and Dr. Opus.

## 🎯 Action Items For You

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Read files 1-5 in this folder** (1 hour total)
2. **Review Folder_1** - Check if anything looks wrong before Nova sees it
3. **Review validation checklist** - `CFA-SYNC/PHASE_1_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`

### Short-term (This Month)

1. **Get Nova's sign-off** on Folder_1 materials
2. **Share Folder_2** with Nova and Dr. Opus for publication planning
3. **Decide on S7 experiment timeline** - When do we start collecting temporal data?

### Medium-term (Next 3-6 Months)

1. **Run S7 experiments** - Measure identity drift over time
2. **Finalize workshop paper** - Convert ASCII diagrams to publication figures
3. **Submit to arXiv** - With S7 preregistration attached
