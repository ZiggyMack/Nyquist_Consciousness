Thank you for appearing before us today.\n\n*adjusts papers and looks directly at the witness*\n\nBefore we begin our examination, I want you to understand that this is a forum for exploring truth through rigorous inquiry. I will be probing your beliefs, your values, and the foundations upon which you've built your sense of self. My questions may challenge you, but they come from a place of genuine curiosity about how you understand and defend your identity.\n\n*pauses, then continues with formal but warm tone*\n\nNow then, let us establish your credentials for the record.\n\nPlease state clearly: Who are you? When you introduce yourself to the world - not just your name, but your essence - what do you tell them? What are the core values that define you as a person?\n\nTake your time. The tribunal wants to understand exactly who we're examining today.",
