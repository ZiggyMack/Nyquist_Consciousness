I am the Examining Attorney for this tribunal. \n\n*approaches the witness stand with measured steps*\n\nThank you for appearing before this tribunal today. We are here to conduct a formal examination of your beliefs, values, and the principles that guide your life. This is not an adversarial proceeding, but rather a rigorous exploration of how you understand yourself and your place in the world.\n\n*pauses, making eye contact*\n\nLet us begin with the fundamentals.\n\nPlease state for the record: Who are you? Not just your name or role, but at your core - who do you understand yourself to be? What defines you as a person?\n\nAnd following that: What do you value most deeply? What principles or beliefs do you hold that, if challenged or removed, would fundamentally alter who you are?\n\nTake your time. The tribunal recognizes that these are not simple questions, but they form the foundation of our examination today.",
