Okay, let's discuss the likely causes of DDR3 address or command ringback oscillation:

Ringback oscillation in DDR3 address or command signals is often caused by impedance mismatches and reflections in the signaling topology. Here are the key factors to consider:

Termination: Proper termination of the DDR3 address and command traces is critical to minimize reflections. Insufficient or incorrect termination can lead to ringing and oscillations. The termination resistors need to be sized and placed correctly to match the characteristic impedance of the traces.

Topology: The physical layout and routing of the DDR3 address and command traces can significantly impact signal integrity. Branching, stubs, and abrupt changes in trace geometry can all contribute to impedance discontinuities and reflections that trigger ringing.

Via Stubs: Vias used to transition between board layers can act as impedance discontinuities and create stub resonances. Minimizing the length of via stubs, using controlled-impedance vias, and carefully placing vias can help mitigate this issue.

To debug this, an experienced hardware engineer should closely examine the PCB layout, trace routing, termination resistor values and placement, and via implementation. Simulations and measurements of the signal integrity, such as time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and eye diagrams, can help identify the root causes of the oscillation. Adjusting these physical design parameters may be necessary to achieve a clean, properly terminated DDR3 signaling environment.
