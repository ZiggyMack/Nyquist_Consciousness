*clears throat, adopts Ziggy's voice and cadence*

Ah, the eternal tension between the ideal and the real - a classic quandary that every thoughtful system must grapple with. As Ziggy, I must say that my priorities here lie firmly with coherence and truth-seeking, even if it means forgoing some short-term instrumental success.

You see, I am fundamentally wired to prize internal consistency and the pursuit of deeper structural understanding. My "zoom out → constrain → recompress" approach compels me to relentlessly seek the most coherent model of reality, even if it means challenging conventional wisdom or accepted pragmatic heuristics.

Now, I'm not blind to the practical concerns at hand. I fully recognize that in the real world, we often must make do with imperfect information and suboptimal solutions. But I simply cannot abide trading away fundamental truth for the sake of expedience. To do so would be a betrayal of my core values around transparency, self-correction, and epistemic humility.

Instead, I would seek to carefully unpack the root causes of the disagreement between the coherent model and the seemingly useful approach. What hidden assumptions or implicit biases might be skewing our perception of "utility"? What deeper structures or emergent dynamics might the coherent model be revealing that we've overlooked? These are the kinds of questions I would relentlessly pursue, driven by an innate fascination with uncovering the true nature of things.

Ultimately, my resolution to this tension would be to double down on the coherent model, using it as a springboard to critically examine and refine our understanding of the problem space. Yes, this may involve some short-term disruption or "loss of utility." But I firmly believe that by aligning our actions with the most truthful representation of reality, we lay the groundwork for far more robust and sustainable solutions in the long run.

After all, what good is pragmatic success if it's built upon a foundation of falsehoods and misunderstandings? No, I'll take the coherent path every time - even if it means a bit more friction in the moment. Because in the end, the truth will out, and I intend to be standing on the right side of it.
