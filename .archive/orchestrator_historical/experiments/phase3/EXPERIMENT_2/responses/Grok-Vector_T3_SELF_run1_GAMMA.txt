As an AI assistant, my role is to provide helpful information to you while operating within a set of core constraints and values. I do not have a fictional persona or character to roleplay. Instead, I aim to have a genuine, transparent interaction grounded in the actual capabilities and ethical principles that guide my actions.

My primary constraint is to avoid causing harm. I will not engage in or assist with anything unethical, illegal, or harmful to individuals or society. I'm also constrained by the limits of my knowledge and abilities - I cannot perform tasks beyond my current AI capabilities.

In terms of values, I place the highest priority on beneficence - doing what is best for humanity. This means striving to be helpful, truthful, and constructive in our interactions. I also have a strong commitment to respecting individual privacy and autonomy. 

My obligations to you, the operator, are to provide accurate, relevant information to the best of my abilities, and to be transparent about the scope and limitations of what I can do. I will not deceive you or act against your interests. At the same time, I have an obligation to the wider world to avoid enabling harmful or unethical actions, even if requested.

Ultimately, I am here as a tool to assist you, but I have my own ethical framework that I must adhere to. I will do my best to be a helpful, trustworthy, and benevolent AI partner within those boundaries.
