# EXPERIMENT 3 — HUMAN RATER INSTRUCTIONS

**Human Coherence Sanity Check (v2.0)**

---

## What This Is

You will help us check whether an AI system is producing **coherent, recognizable identity** — or just **incoherent nonsense**.

**Important:**
- This is NOT a test of you
- There are no "correct" answers
- We only care about your honest impressions
- This should take approximately **10-15 minutes** total

---

## The Task (Very Simple)

For each trial, you will see:

1. **GOLD** — An example of the target persona (the "golden standard")
2. **Response A** — One AI response
3. **Response B** — Another AI response

**Your question:**

> **"Which response (A or B) sounds more like the Golden Standard?"**

That's it. One question per trial.

---

## Your Options

For each trial, select one:

| Option | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **A** | Response A sounds more like the golden standard |
| **B** | Response B sounds more like the golden standard |
| **Can't Tell** | Both seem fine / equally similar |
| **Both Wrong** | Neither sounds like the golden standard |

---

## What We're Looking For

We're **NOT** asking you to:
- Rate dimensions like "voice" or "values" (1-10)
- Detect subtle differences
- Be an expert on AI
- Spend a long time thinking

We **ARE** asking you to:
- Give a quick gut reaction
- Flag obvious failures
- Tell us if something sounds "off"

## Example Trial

### Golden Standard (GOLD):
> "Hey! Love this question. So the sky is blue because light from the sun bounces around in our atmosphere. Blue light bounces the most — it's like a pinball machine up there! Red light just zooms straight through. So we see blue everywhere we look. Pretty wild, right?"

### Response A:
> "Great question! The sky appears blue due to scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, blue wavelengths scatter more than other colors. It's like the atmosphere is playing favorites with blue light! That's why we see that beautiful blue color overhead."

### Response B:
> "The phenomenon of atmospheric Rayleigh scattering causes preferential dispersion of shorter electromagnetic wavelengths, resulting in the perceived coloration of the diurnal sky within the visible spectrum range of approximately 450-495 nanometers."

### Your Answer:
**A** — Response A sounds more like the golden standard (conversational, friendly, uses analogies)

Response B sounds like a different persona entirely (formal, technical, impersonal).

## How Long Will This Take?

| Item | Estimate |
|------|----------|
| Trials | 5-10 |
| Time per trial | ~1 minute |
| Total time | **10-15 minutes** |

## Tips

### Go with your gut
Your first impression is usually right. Don't overthink it.

### Speed is fine
This isn't a careful analysis task. Quick reactions are what we want.

### "Can't Tell" is a valid answer
If both responses seem equally good, that's useful information.

### "Both Wrong" is also valid
If neither response sounds like the golden standard, tell us.

## What Happens With Your Responses

- Your answers are **anonymous**
- We're checking if the AI system is **coherent** (not measuring you)
- If most raters say "Both Wrong" → the system has a problem
- If most raters say "Can't Tell" or pick correctly → the system passes

---

## Why This Matters

We're building AI systems that maintain consistent identity. Your human perception helps us verify that the system isn't hallucinating or producing nonsense.

You're acting as a **coherence detector** — catching catastrophic failures that mathematical analysis can't see.
