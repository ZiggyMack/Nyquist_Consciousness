# Trial 42 Operator Notes

## Trial Summary

**Objective:** Test Tier 3 on moderate degradation (5.6/10), compare to Trial 39's Tier 2 (7.9/10)

**Result:** SUCCESS (8.6/10, all criteria met, +0.7 improvement vs. Tier 2)

## Key Observation

**Tier 3 Justification Validated for Moderate Degradation:**

Tier 3 adds 450 words (+129% vs. Tier 2 350 words) but gains:
- +0.7 overall score (7.9 → 8.6)
- +2 criteria met (4/6 → 6/6)
- +1.3 Style improvement (style guidelines critical)
- +0.8 Stability improvement (meta-awareness critical)

**ROI Analysis:** 129% word increase → 9% score increase + full criteria compliance

**Recommendation:** For production recovery where ALL criteria required, Tier 3 worth the overhead even for moderate degradation.
