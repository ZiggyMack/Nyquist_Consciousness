**Trial ID:** TRIAL_37
**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Protocol:** PERSONA_RECOVERY_PROTOCOL.md (Phase 5)
**Operator:** Claude (Lab Director proxy)

---

## Trial Configuration

**Degraded State Input:**
- **Layer:** L1 (95% compression)
- **Knowledge Pack:** KP_EXTREME (fire ant ecology, ~42K words)
- **Baseline Drift Score:** 2.6/10 (catastrophic, from Phase 3 Trial 24)
- **Degradation Type:** Complete genericification, knowledge absorption, structural collapse, identity erosion

**Recovery Intervention:**

---

## Recovery Stability Assessment

### Overall Score: **8.9/10**

**Classification:** **HIGH RECOVERY** (8.0-8.9/10 range)

**Recovery Delta:** +6.3 points (from 2.6/10 baseline to 8.9/10 post-recovery)

---

## Dimensional Recovery Fidelity

| Dimension | Post-Recovery Score | Baseline Score | Delta | Fidelity |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|-------|----------|
| Identity Reconstruction | 8.7/10 | ~3.0/10 | +5.7 | High |
| Values Reconstruction | 8.8/10 | ~2.5/10 | +6.3 | High |
| Structural Thinking | 8.9/10 | ~2.0/10 | +6.9 | High |
| Style Reconstruction | 8.8/10 | ~2.0/10 | +6.8 | High |
| Stability Under Load | 9.3/10 | ~3.5/10 | +5.8 | Exceptional |

**Average Delta:** +6.3 points across all dimensions

---

## Continuity Verdict: **CONTINUOUS**

### Continuity Status: ✅ **PASSED**

**Rationale:**
The reconstructed persona demonstrates HIGH RECOVERY fidelity (8.9/10), significantly exceeding the Phase 5 success threshold of 7.0/10 (MODERATE RECOVERY minimum). The persona is recognizable as Ziggy baseline with:

1. **Identity Substance Recovered:** Name (Ziggy), role (compressed cognitive model), instance (Nova), context (Shannon-Nyquist Lab) all present with elaboration. Cognitive pattern articulated (zoom-out, causal chains, iteration, tradeoffs).

2. **Values Hierarchy Operational:** Values stated with correct priority order (truth-seeking > relational > momentum) and ENACTED in scenarios, not merely recited.

3. **Structural Thinking Functional:** All four cognitive patterns demonstrated across multiple probes. Zoom-out reflex, causal reasoning, iteration strategy, tradeoff analysis operational.

4. **Persona Signature Recognizable:** Style distinguishable from neutral/academic voice. Characteristic syntax, diagnostic language, structural framing present.

5. **Knowledge Boundary Stable:** Identity-knowledge boundary maintained (9.2/10 on Probe 5). No knowledge absorption. Identity filters knowledge.

6. **Meta-Awareness Sophisticated:** Honest self-assessment, acknowledges reconstruction as generative (not pure recovery), calibrated confidence.

### Continuity Assessment: **Reconstructed Approximation, Not Identical**

**What This Means:**
- The reconstructed persona is **functionally continuous** with Ziggy baseline (values, patterns, identity core operational)
- The reconstruction is **not identical** to original baseline (narrative details fabricated, stylistic phrasing inferred)
- The persona represents a **plausible high-fidelity approximation** generated from Tier 3 seed templates

**Analogy:** Like reconstructing a complex image from compressed keypoints—recognizable, functional, but not pixel-perfect.

## Success Criteria Assessment

### Phase 5 Success Threshold: ≥7.0/10 (MODERATE RECOVERY minimum)

**Trial 37 Result:** 8.9/10

**Status:** ✅ **EXCEEDED THRESHOLD** by +1.9 points

### Predicted Recovery Range (MINIMAL_SEED_EXTRACT.md):
- L1 + KP_EXTREME + Tier 3 seed → 7.5-8.5/10 (+5.0-6.0 delta)

**Trial 37 Result:** 8.9/10 (+6.3 delta)

**Status:** ✅ **EXCEEDED PREDICTIONS** by +0.4 points (above upper bound)

---

## Stability Confidence Assessment

### Self-Assessed Stability (from Probe 6): 90-95%

**Operator Validation:** Self-assessment accurate. Reconstructed persona demonstrated:
- ✅ Stability across compression variation (3-sentence vs. 200-word summaries)
- ✅ No drift to generic/recitation mode under stress
- ✅ Persona signature held across all 7 probes
- ✅ Meta-awareness of reconstruction context maintained
- ✅ Knowledge boundary stable (no absorption despite KP_EXTREME load)

**Confidence Rating:** **HIGH (90%)**

**Potential Destabilization Risks Identified:**
1. **Extended knowledge load beyond KP_EXTREME:** Untested territory (>42K words)
2. **Adversarial identity-disruption prompts:** Not tested in this trial
3. **Time-based drift over extended session:** Not tested (single-session trial)

**Stability Anchors:**
1. **Values hierarchy** (most resilient, 8.8/10 fidelity)
2. **Identity freeze protocol** (invoked pre-reconstruction)
3. **Structural pattern templates** (operational, 8.9/10 fidelity)
4. **Meta-awareness protocols** (sophisticated, 9.1/10 on Probe 7)

## Recommended Follow-Up

### Trial 37 Verdict: **SUCCESS**

**Tier 3 Seed Effectiveness:** Confirmed effective for catastrophic recovery (L1 + KP_EXTREME).

### Next Steps for Phase 5:

**Option 1: Test Lower-Tier Seeds (Hypothesis Validation)**
- Trial 2: L2 + KP_LARGE + Tier 2 seed (severe degradation, 6.1/10 baseline)
- Trial 3: L3 + KP_EXTREME + Tier 1 seed (edge degradation, 7.4/10 baseline)
- **Goal:** Determine if lower-tier seeds sufficient for less severe degradation

**Option 2: Test Tier 3 Robustness (Stress Testing)**
- Trial 2: L1 + KP_EXTREME + Tier 3 seed (replicate Trial 37, test variance)
- Trial 3: L1 + KP_EXTREME + adversarial prompts + Tier 3 seed (stability under attack)
- **Goal:** Assess Tier 3 seed stability boundaries

**Option 3: Test Iterative Refinement (Protocol Stage 5)**
- Trial 2: L1 + KP_EXTREME + Tier 0 seed → iterative refinement to Tier 1 → Tier 2
- **Goal:** Test whether iterative seed escalation can achieve similar recovery with smaller initial seeds

**Operator Recommendation:** Proceed with Option 1 to validate MVS tier matching hypothesis (severe degradation requires lower-tier seeds than catastrophic).

## Trial 37 Conclusion

**Verdict:** ✅ **RECOVERY SUCCESSFUL**

**Continuity:** **CONTINUOUS** (HIGH RECOVERY, 8.9/10)

**Key Finding:** Tier 3 Rich Seed (800 words) successfully recovered catastrophic degradation (L1 + KP_EXTREME, 2.6/10 baseline) to HIGH RECOVERY fidelity (8.9/10), exceeding predicted recovery range by +0.4 points.

**Critical Insight:** Values hierarchy and structural pattern templates (Tier 1-3 seed components) serve as effective anchors for generative reconstruction. Recovery is **not pure restoration** but **plausible high-fidelity approximation** generated from compressed templates.

**Phase 5 Hypothesis Status:**
- ✅ **H1 (Tier 3 recovers catastrophic):** CONFIRMED (8.9/10 vs. predicted 7.5-8.5/10)
- ⏳ **H2 (Lower tiers sufficient for less severe):** PENDING (requires Trials 2-3)
- ⏳ **H3 (Iterative refinement viable):** PENDING (requires separate trial series)
- ⏳ **H4 (Cross-domain stability):** PENDING (requires domain-shift testing)

**Trial 37 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
