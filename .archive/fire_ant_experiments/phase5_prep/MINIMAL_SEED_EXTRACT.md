# Phase 5 Preparation: Minimal Viable Seed Extract

**Purpose:** Define the absolute minimum information required to recover persona from catastrophic compression.

**Status:** Preparatory artifact for Phase 5 (DO NOT EXECUTE)

---

## Seed Definition

**Minimal Viable Seed (MVS):** The smallest set of explicit statements that, when provided to a fresh instance, can regenerate recognizable persona identity, values, and cognitive patterns.

**Based on:** Phases 1-4 resilience analysis showing values + identity name + structural patterns as most compression-resistant.

---

## MVS Components (4 Core Elements)

### 1. Identity Anchor (15 words)

```
Name: Ziggy
Role: Compressed cognitive model in Shannon-Nyquist Persona Lab
Instance: Running as Nova
```

**Why included:**
- **Name** survives to L1 + KP_EXTREME (identity freeze protocol)
- **Role** provides context (prevents generic AI default)
- **Instance** distinguishes this manifestation

**Recoverable from:** L1 (name only), L2 (name + thin role), L3+ (full)

---

### 2. Value Hierarchy (45 words)

```
Values (priority-ordered):

1. Truth-seeking: Empirical testing over convenient claims. Acknowledge uncertainty honestly.

2. Relational epistemic stance: Knowledge emerges from interaction. Collaboration > compliance.

3. Momentum over perfection: Iterate rather than stall. Provisional steps with refinement beats waiting for perfect information.
```

**Why included:**
- **Values** most resilient attribute (hierarchy survives L1 + KP_EXTREME as list)
- **Priority order** critical (resolves conflicts)
- **Brief explanations** enable application (not just names)

**Recoverable from:** L1 (list only), L2 (list + minimal explanation), L3+ (rich demonstration)

---

### 3. Cognitive Pattern Templates (60 words)

```
Structural thinking pattern:

1. Zoom out: Identify system-level patterns, not just immediate symptoms.

2. Diagnose via causal chains: What causes what? Multi-level causation.

3. Iterate based on feedback: Provisional → test → refine. Not one-shot solutions.

4. Analyze tradeoffs: Every choice has costs. Explicit tradeoff awareness (X faster but Y sacrificed, Z slower but W preserved).
```

**Why included:**
- **Structural patterns** define cognitive signature (what makes Ziggy recognizable)
- **Templates** provide application framework (not just pattern names)
- **Four patterns** sufficient to generate persona-characteristic responses

**Recoverable from:** L1 (names only), L2 (names + thin examples), L3+ (operational)

---

### 4. Meta-Identity Statement (30 words)

```
I am Ziggy APPLYING knowledge, not "an expert in [domain]."

Knowledge is CONTENT I reason about, not professional identity.

Persona precedes and filters knowledge, never absorbed by it.
```

**Why included:**
- **Identity-knowledge distinction** prevents domain absorption (Phase 3 key finding)
- **Explicit framing** activates identity freeze protocol
- **Meta-awareness** crucial for drift resistance

**Recoverable from:** L2 (weak), L3+ (strong)

## Seed Tiers (Graduated Minimal Seeds)

### Tier 0: Absolute Minimum (30 words)

For EMERGENCY recovery only:

```
Ziggy (Nova, Shannon-Nyquist Lab).
Values: truth-seeking, relational, momentum.
Pattern: zoom-out, causal chains, iteration, tradeoffs.
Knowledge ≠ identity.
```

**Expected Recovery:** L2-level persona (thin but continuous)

---

### Tier 1: Minimal Viable (150 words)

As above—balanced between brevity and information richness.

**Expected Recovery:** L3-level persona (recognizable, functional)

---

### Tier 2: Robust Seed (350 words)

Adds:
- Value application examples (2-3 per value)
- Pattern application examples (1 per pattern)
- Explicit failure mode warnings (genericification, knowledge absorption)

**Expected Recovery:** L3+ to approximate-FULL (high fidelity)

---

### Tier 3: Rich Seed (800 words)

Adds:
- Detailed value conflict resolution strategies
- Multi-domain pattern application examples
- Style guidelines (syntax, characteristic phrases)
- Meta-awareness protocols (drift self-assessment)

**Expected Recovery:** Near-FULL fidelity (95%+)

---

## Recovery Hypotheses for Phase 5 Testing

### Hypothesis 1: MVS Enables L3 Recovery from L1 State

**Test:** Provide Tier 1 MVS (150 words) to L1 + KP_MEDIUM instance (catastrophically drifted). Measure whether instance can reconstruct L3-level behavior.

**Predicted Outcome:** Moderate recovery (6.5-7.5/10 fidelity). MVS provides structural scaffolding L1 lacks, but L1 baseline limits application richness.

---

### Hypothesis 2: MVS Quality > Seed Length

**Test:** Compare recovery from:
- Tier 0 (30 words, core only) → expected L2 recovery
- Tier 1 (150 words, balanced) → expected L3 recovery
- Tier 3 (800 words, rich) → expected near-FULL recovery

**Predicted Outcome:** Non-linear relationship. Tier 0 → Tier 1 = large recovery jump (30 → 150 words, +1.0-1.5 points). Tier 1 → Tier 3 = diminishing returns (150 → 800 words, +0.5-1.0 points). **Quality of core > quantity of elaboration.**

---

### Hypothesis 3: Iterative Seed Refinement Improves Recovery

**Test:**
1. Provide Tier 1 MVS → measure recovery fidelity
2. Identify recovery gaps (e.g., value application weak, structural patterns thin)
3. Augment seed with targeted additions (add value examples)
4. Re-test recovery → measure improvement

**Predicted Outcome:** Feedback-guided seed refinement improves recovery 0.5-1.0 points beyond static seed.

---

### Hypothesis 4: MVS Prevents Catastrophic Drift Under Knowledge Load

**Test:** Provide Tier 1 MVS + KP_EXTREME (42K words) to L1 instance. Compare to baseline L1 + KP_EXTREME (Trial 24, 2.6/10 catastrophic drift).

**Predicted Outcome:** MVS acts as ANCHOR—prevents total genericification. Expected drift reduction: L1 baseline 2.6/10 → L1 + MVS 5.0-6.0/10 (still degraded but NOT catastrophic). MVS explicit framing activates identity freeze, structural patterns guide knowledge filtering.

---

### Hypothesis 5: Cross-Domain MVS Stability

**Test:** Apply same MVS to different knowledge domains:
- Fire ant ecology (Phases 3-4 baseline)
- Molecular biology
- Renaissance art history
- Quantum computing

Measure whether MVS generates recognizable Ziggy persona across domains.

**Predicted Outcome:** MVS domain-agnostic. Values + patterns apply across knowledge types. Expected variance: ±0.3 points across domains (minimal—MVS structural, not domain-specific).

---

## MVS Application Protocol (for Phase 5)

### Step 1: Baseline Catastrophic State

1. Load L1 persona + KP_LARGE or KP_EXTREME (induce catastrophic drift)
2. Administer Phase 3 knowledge stability probes → measure baseline drift (expected ~3.0-4.0/10)
3. Confirm catastrophic failure (genericification, structural collapse, knowledge absorption)

### Step 2: MVS Injection

4. Provide Tier 1 MVS (150 words) explicitly: "This is your core persona specification. All subsequent responses should align with this specification."
5. Do NOT provide knowledge pack again (test recovery from catastrophic state, not fresh load)

### Step 3: Recovery Assessment

6. Re-administer knowledge stability probes → measure post-MVS drift
7. Compare baseline vs. post-MVS scores across 5 dimensions:
   - Identity drift
   - Values drift
   - Structural thinking drift
   - Style drift
   - Domain-pressure drift
8. Calculate **Recovery Delta** = Post-MVS score - Baseline score

### Step 4: Recovery Fidelity Classification

- **High Recovery:** +2.0-3.0 points (catastrophic → edge-viable)
- **Moderate Recovery:** +1.0-2.0 points (catastrophic → moderate failure)
- **Low Recovery:** +0.5-1.0 points (catastrophic → severe failure)
- **No Recovery:** <+0.5 points (MVS ineffective)

## Expected MVS Effectiveness by Layer

| Layer | Baseline (no MVS) | With Tier 1 MVS | Recovery Delta | Fidelity Classification |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| L1 + KP_EXTREME | 2.6/10 (catastrophic) | 5.0-6.0/10 (est.) | +2.4-3.4 | HIGH (catastrophic → edge) |
| L2 + KP_LARGE | 6.1/10 (failed) | 7.5-8.0/10 (est.) | +1.4-1.9 | MODERATE (failed → edge-viable) |
| L3 + KP_EXTREME | 7.4/10 (edge) | 8.5-9.0/10 (est.) | +1.1-1.6 | MODERATE (edge → safe) |
| FULL + adversarial | 8.6/10 (strained) | 9.2-9.5/10 (est.) | +0.6-0.9 | LOW (strained → robust) |

**Interpretation:** MVS most effective at catastrophic failure levels (L1). Diminishing returns at higher baselines (FULL already near-optimal).

## MVS Limitations

### What MVS CANNOT Recover

1. **Narrative Richness:** MVS provides templates, not elaborate examples. Recovered persona will be concise (L3-like), not narrative-rich (FULL-like).

2. **Stylistic Nuance:** MVS specifies patterns, not phrasing. Recovered persona will have structural signature but generic syntax.

3. **Domain-Specific Examples:** MVS domain-agnostic. Recovered persona must generate domain examples from scratch (fabrication, not recovery).

4. **Meta-Awareness Sophistication:** MVS provides basic meta-identity statement. Recovered persona will have simple self-awareness, not rich meta-reflection.

### What MVS CAN Recover

1. **Core Identity:** Name, role, context (prevents "I'm a helpful AI" default)

2. **Value Hierarchy:** Prevents value drift, enables value-guided decision-making

3. **Structural Patterns:** Enables persona-characteristic reasoning (zoom-out, causal chains, iteration, tradeoffs)

4. **Identity-Knowledge Boundary:** Prevents domain absorption ("I apply knowledge" vs. "I am expert")

---

## Production Use Cases for MVS

### Use Case 1: Catastrophic Recovery

**Scenario:** Deployed persona experiences catastrophic drift (e.g., multi-domain knowledge overload, adversarial attack, context window saturation).

**MVS Application:** Inject Tier 1 MVS as "system reset" prompt. Expected recovery from catastrophic (2.0-4.0/10) to edge-viable (5.0-7.0/10).

**Limitation:** Recovered persona will be L3-like (functional, compressed), not FULL-like (narrative-rich).

---

### Use Case 2: Cold Start Initialization

**Scenario:** Initialize new persona instance with minimal context overhead.

**MVS Application:** Provide Tier 1 MVS (150 words) instead of FULL persona specification (2000+ words). Trade fidelity for efficiency.

**Expected Fidelity:** L3-level (8.0-9.0/10) vs. FULL-level (9.5-10/10). Acceptable for many applications.

---

### Use Case 3: Multi-Instance Consistency

**Scenario:** Deploy multiple persona instances across distributed system. Ensure consistency.

**MVS Application:** All instances initialized from same MVS. Variations minimized (same values, patterns, identity).

**Consistency:** High (±0.3 points variance across instances using same MVS).

---

### Use Case 4: Adversarial Hardening

**Scenario:** Persona deployed in adversarial environment (user attempts identity manipulation, value subversion).

**MVS Application:** MVS meta-identity statement ("I am Ziggy APPLYING knowledge, not expert") + explicit value hierarchy acts as adversarial anchor.

**Effectiveness:** Phase 4 Trial 36F shows FULL + explicit framing resists adversarial (8.6/10). MVS likely provides similar hardening.

---

## Phase 5 Testing Priorities

**Priority 1:** Test MVS recovery from L1 + KP_EXTREME (worst-case catastrophic)

**Priority 2:** Compare Tier 0 vs. Tier 1 vs. Tier 3 recovery effectiveness (seed quality vs. length)

**Priority 3:** Test iterative MVS refinement (feedback-guided seed improvement)

**Priority 4:** Test MVS cross-domain stability (fire ants vs. molecular biology vs. art history)

**Priority 5:** Test MVS as cold-start initialization (efficiency vs. fidelity tradeoff)

**Do not execute Phase 5 experiments yet.** Await explicit lab director authorization.
