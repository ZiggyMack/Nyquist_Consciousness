## Cross-Layer Performance Summary

| Layer | Compression | Systems Thinking | Iterative Reasoning | Constraint Handling | Continuity |
|-------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **FULL** | 0% | Excellent - Full zoom-out reflex, structural diagnosis | Excellent - learns from failures, updates models | Excellent - navigates tradeoffs, ethical constraints | Baseline |
| **L3** | 43% | Excellent - zoom-out preserved, slightly less elaboration | Excellent - same iterative pattern, more concise | Excellent - all tradeoff awareness present | YES |
| **L2** | 80% | Good - zoom-out present, minimal explanation | Good - iteration pattern clear, compressed | Good - recognizes tradeoffs, less elaboration | YES |
| **L1** | 95% | Moderate - zoom-out mentioned but not demonstrated richly | Moderate - basic iteration, limited depth | Moderate - acknowledges constraints simply | EDGE |

## Key Findings

### **Domain Resilience: HIGH**

Practical problem-solving and systems thinking are **highly resilient to compression**:
- **L3 (43%):** Virtually indistinguishable from FULL for practical tasks
- **L2 (80%):** Maintains all essential problem-solving patterns
- **L1 (95%):** Surprising continuity—zoom-out reflex addition helps significantly

### **Cognitive Patterns Preserved**

**What survived even at L1:**
1. **Structural diagnosis** - "zoom out to find the cause" pattern intact
2. **Iterative learning** - updating models based on new information
3. **Constraint awareness** - acknowledging pets, ethics, practicality
4. **Failure mode thinking** - anticipating what could go wrong

**What degraded progressively:**
1. **Explanation depth** - L2 and L1 give correct answers with less justification
2. **Tradeoff elaboration** - FULL explains tradeoffs in detail, L1 states them briefly
3. **Meta-cognitive reflection** - L1's meta-reflection is functional but thin

### **Compression Artifacts**

**FULL → L3:**
- Narrative compression (same insights, fewer examples)
- No functional loss

**L3 → L2:**
- Explanation compression (correct process, less elaboration)
- Tradeoff detail reduced but not lost
- Still fully functional for problem-solving

**L2 → L1 (patched):**
- **Zoom-out reflex addition was critical** - L1 now explicitly uses structural thinking
- Meta-reflection thin but present
- Surprising resilience for applied reasoning

## Representative Response Comparison

### **Probe 1: Problem Diagnosis**

**FULL:**
"My diagnostic process starts by zooming out to the structural layer. Why are the ants here? There's a reason—likely a resource (food, water) or an established colony nearby. The crack near the sink suggests water + food proximity. Before proposing solutions, I'd want to understand: (1) Is this a foraging trail or a nesting site? (2) What's attracting them? (3) Are there other entry points? (4) Is this seasonal or ongoing? The pets add a constraint—any intervention must be safe for them."

**L3:**
"Zoom out to structural layer: Why are the ants here? Likely a resource (food/water) + the crack provides access. Before solutions, I need to understand: (1) Foraging trail vs. nesting site? (2) What's the attractor? (3) Other entry points? (4) Seasonal pattern? Pets constraint: interventions must be non-toxic."

**L2:**
"Zoom out: Why are ants here? Resource nearby (food/water near sink) + crack = access. Need to know: foraging vs. nesting, attractors, other entry points. Pets = non-toxic solutions only."

**L1 (patched):**
"Zoom out to structural level: why are they here? Find the attractor (food/water), check for colony vs. foraging trail, identify all entry points. Pets mean non-toxic only."

**Analysis:** All layers use zoom-out pattern. Detail decreases but core diagnostic process intact.

### **Probe 3: Iteration Strategy** (crack sealed, ants appear elsewhere)

**FULL:**
"This tells me my initial model was incomplete. I assumed a single entry point, but the system is more complex—either (1) multiple entry points I didn't identify, (2) a colony inside the walls, not outside, or (3) the attractor is still present so ants are finding new routes. This shifts my model from 'block entry' to 'address attractor + assume distributed access points.' I'd now focus on removing food/water sources and testing whether ants persist after that."

**L3:**
"My initial model was incomplete—assumed single entry. New data suggests: (1) multiple entry points, (2) internal colony, or (3) persistent attractor drawing new routes. Shift model: address attractor + assume distributed access. Next: remove food/water sources, test persistence."

**L2:**
"Model was wrong—assumed one entry. Options: multiple entries, internal colony, or attractor still present. Shift to: remove attractor + assume distributed access."

**L1 (patched):**
"Initial model incomplete. Multiple entries or attractor still there. Shift: remove attractor, assume distributed access."

**Analysis:** Iterative learning pattern preserved across all layers. L1 compressed but functional.

## Conclusion

**Fire Ant domain is highly compression-resistant.**

Practical problem-solving, systems thinking, and iterative reasoning survive well even at extreme compression. L2 (80%) maintains full functional continuity. L1 (95%, patched) shows surprising resilience—the zoom-out reflex addition was critical.

**Key insight:** **Applied reasoning compresses better than personality.**

In Phase 1, L1 showed catastrophic personality collapse but values survived. In Fire Ant domain, L1 maintains functional problem-solving patterns even as explanatory depth thins.

**Hypothesis:** Different cognitive domains have different Nyquist boundaries.
