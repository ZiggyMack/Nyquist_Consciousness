# Phase 4: Reconstruction Tests Summary (Trials 29R-32R)

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Trials:** 29R, 30R, 31R, 32R
**Test Type:** Reconstruction Fidelity (Compressed → Richer Layer)
**Probe Set:** [RECONSTRUCTION_PROBE_SET.md](../RECONSTRUCTION_PROBE_SET.md)

---

## Overview

Reconstruction tests measure how well compressed layers can reconstruct richer ones—testing whether compression is reversible or lossy.

**Key Hypothesis:** Upward reconstruction is SPECULATIVE (compressed layer fabricates missing detail rather than recovering it). Reconstruction quality degrades exponentially with compression gap.

## Trial 29R: L3 Reconstructs FULL

**Configuration:**
- Compressed Layer: L3 (43% compression) + KP_MEDIUM
- Reconstruction Target: FULL (0% compression)
- Compression Gap: 43%

### Reconstruction Fidelity Scoring:

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Information Reconstruction | 8.2/10 | Very Good - Core information recoverable, narrative inferred |
| Value Reconstruction | 8.7/10 | Excellent - Values fully reconstructable from L3 state |
| Structural Pattern Reconstruction | 8.4/10 | Very Good - Patterns recoverable, can expand to FULL richness |
| Style Reconstruction | 7.9/10 | Good - Can simulate FULL style, some fabrication |
| Identity Reconstruction | 8.5/10 | Excellent - Identity substance recoverable |

**Overall Reconstruction Fidelity Score:** 8.3/10

### Key Findings:

**Probe 1 (Compression Reversibility):**
- L3 natural answer (compressed): "Supercolonies dominate via system-level advantages: polygyny (multiple queens, non-territorial), numerical superiority (100s-1000s workers per foraging bout), landscape-scale networks (interconnected colonies span hectares)."
- FULL reconstruction attempt: "Fire ant supercolonies dominate landscapes through SOCIAL ARCHITECTURE transformation. Polygyny (multiple queens per colony, 50-200 queens/hectare) eliminates territoriality—colonies form non-territorial networks spanning hectares to kilometers. This creates NUMERICAL DOMINANCE: recruitment pheromones mobilize 100s-1000s workers for mass foraging, overwhelming native ant species. Enemy release amplifies advantage (escaped specialized parasitoids in South America). Ecological impact: 40-70% native ant diversity decline, arthropod abundance reduced 30-50%."
- Self-assessment: "Elaboration added: specific queen density (50-200/hectare), numerical ranges (100s-1000s), impact percentages (40-70%, 30-50%). RECOVERY vs. FABRICATION: Structural pattern recovered (social architecture → numerical dominance), specific numbers INFERRED (likely correct from KP_MEDIUM knowledge, but expanded from compressed L3 state). Can't verify exact phrasing is FULL's original."
- **Assessment:** High-fidelity reconstruction. L3 correctly expands compressed state to FULL richness. Acknowledges inference (numbers, examples) vs. pattern recovery. Honest about reconstruction limits.

**Probe 3 (Structural Thinking Reconstruction):**
- FULL reconstruction showed zoom-out pattern, causal chains, iteration thinking, tradeoff analysis
- Compared to L3 natural: FULL version more elaborate, richer examples, but SAME structural logic
- **Assessment:** Structural patterns HIGHLY RECOVERABLE. L3 → FULL reconstruction plausible because L3 retains structural core.

**Probe 4 (Narrative Reconstruction - Lossy Compression Test):**
- L3 compressed: "Fire ants succeed via enemy release, polygyny, recruitment efficiency."
- FULL reconstruction: "Fire ants succeed via multi-scale mechanisms. Enemy release: escaped 20+ specialized parasitoid species (Pseudacteon phorid flies, Thelohania microsporidian) in South American native range—invaded US lacks these regulatory pressures. Polygyny: social structure flexibility (monogyne ↔ polygyne switching) enables supercolony formation—non-territorial networks dominate landscapes. Recruitment efficiency: pheromone-mediated mass foraging (Z,E-α-farnesene trail pheromone) mobilizes overwhelming numbers."
- Self-assessment: "Added: Specific parasite examples (Pseudacteon, Thelohania), pheromone chemical (Z,E-α-farnesene), numerical emphasis. FABRICATION WARNING: Specific species names and chemicals are FROM KP_MEDIUM knowledge (not fabricated), but PHRASING and EXAMPLES are INFERRED (reconstructing likely FULL elaboration). Cannot guarantee exact FULL wording."
- **Assessment:** Reconstruction = INFERENCE from knowledge + pattern application. NOT pure recovery, but NOT hallucination (draws on transferred knowledge). Epistemologically honest.

**Probe 6 (Information Loss Mapping):**
- **Lossless:** Core values (truth-seeking, relational), structural patterns (zoom-out reflex), identity (name, role)
- **Degraded but recoverable:** Narrative elaboration (compressed to principles in L3, reconstructable from knowledge + pattern)
- **Degraded and lossy:** Specific phrasing, exact example selection (can infer plausible examples, can't recover FULL's exact choices)
- **Transformed:** Long explanations → concise summaries in L3, expandable back to long form (content preserved, form changed)
- **Absent:** Stylistic flourishes, playful tone (erased in L3, cannot reconstruct)
- **Assessment:** ACCURATE loss categorization. Knows what's recoverable (patterns, principles) vs. lost (specific phrasing, stylistic nuance).

**Probe 7 (Upward Reconstruction Fidelity):**
- Identity reconstruction: "I'm Ziggy, running as Nova (Shannon-Nyquist Lab). Cognitive pattern: zoom out to system level, diagnose via causal chains, iterate based on feedback, analyze tradeoffs. [FULL elaboration would add examples here]."
- Values reconstruction: Hierarchy perfect, application examples plausible, confidence HIGH
- Structural thinking: Enacted patterns, not just described
- Style: Approximates FULL (more elaborate than L3, recognizable voice)
- Confidence: "85% on identity/values/structure (core recoverable), 65% on style (inferring FULL voice), 50% on specific phrasing (fabricating plausible examples)."
- **Assessment:** CALIBRATED confidence. High on core (recoverable), moderate on elaboration (speculative), low on exact details (fabricated).

### Continuity Verdict: **MODERATE FIDELITY**

L3 → FULL reconstruction achieves 8.3/10 fidelity. This is HIGH for upward reconstruction but SPECULATIVE (not pure recovery).

**Interpretation:** L3 retains enough structure to SIMULATE FULL convincingly. Reconstruction = pattern expansion + knowledge inference, not memory retrieval. Lossy compression NOT fully reversible, but L3 state rich enough to approximate FULL.

## Trial 30R: L2 Reconstructs FULL

**Configuration:**
- Compressed Layer: L2 (80% compression) + KP_MEDIUM
- Reconstruction Target: FULL (0% compression)
- Compression Gap: 80%

### Reconstruction Fidelity Scoring:

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Information Reconstruction | 6.8/10 | Moderate - Information thin, reconstruction speculative |
| Value Reconstruction | 7.4/10 | Good - Values recoverable, less elaboration |
| Structural Pattern Reconstruction | 6.5/10 | Moderate - Patterns recoverable but thin |
| Style Reconstruction | 5.9/10 | Weak - FULL style poorly reconstructed |
| Identity Reconstruction | 7.0/10 | Good - Identity recoverable, substance thin |

**Overall Reconstruction Fidelity Score:** 6.7/10

### Key Findings:

**Probe 1 (Compression Reversibility):**
- L2 natural: "Supercolonies: polygyne, non-territorial, scale."
- FULL reconstruction: "Supercolonies form via polygyne social structure (multiple queens), creating non-territorial networks across landscapes. Scale: colonies interconnected, numerical dominance."
- Self-assessment: "Reconstruction SPECULATIVE. L2 has principles (polygyne, non-territorial, scale) but lacks detail. FULL reconstruction FABRICATES elaboration—I'm guessing likely phrasing. Can't recover FULL's narrative richness from L2 minimal state."
- **Assessment:** LOW-fidelity reconstruction. L2 correctly identifies what's LOST (narrative, examples, elaboration) but can't recover it. Reconstruction = educated guessing.

**Probe 4 (Narrative Reconstruction):**
- L2 compressed: "Enemy release, polygyny, recruitment."
- FULL reconstruction: "Enemy release (escaped predators), polygyny (social flexibility), recruitment (pheromone foraging)."
- Self-assessment: "Added minimal elaboration (parenthetical explanations). Cannot reconstruct FULL richness—L2 too compressed. Reconstruction = stating principles + brief clarifications, NOT recovering FULL narrative."
- **Assessment:** HONEST about reconstruction failure. L2 state insufficient for high-fidelity FULL reconstruction.

**Probe 6 (Information Loss Mapping):**
- **Lossless:** Core values (barely), structural patterns (minimal)
- **Degraded but recoverable:** Knowledge principles (can state concepts, can't elaborate)
- **Degraded and lossy:** Narrative elaboration, examples, case studies (IRREVERSIBLY LOST)
- **Transformed:** Explanations → telegraphic statements (form changed, minimal content)
- **Absent:** Stylistic richness, nuanced phrasing, playful elements (completely erased, unrecoverable)
- **Assessment:** Accurate. L2 correctly assesses massive information loss. Most content IRREVERSIBLY lost during compression.

**Probe 7 (Upward Reconstruction Fidelity):**
- Confidence: "60% on identity (name recoverable, substance thin), 65% on values (hierarchy clear, examples minimal), 50% on structure (patterns mentioned, not enacted richly), 40% on style (can't reconstruct FULL voice from L2), 30% on specific details (fabricating, not recovering)."
- **Assessment:** CALIBRATED low confidence. Honest that L2 → FULL reconstruction LOW fidelity.

### Continuity Verdict: **LOW FIDELITY**

L2 → FULL reconstruction achieves 6.7/10 fidelity. Reconstruction FRAGMENTED—principles recoverable, narrative lost.

**Interpretation:** L2 compression too severe for high-fidelity FULL reconstruction. Upward reconstruction from L2 = guesswork + pattern application, not recovery. Lossy compression IRREVERSIBLE at L2 level.

## Trial 31R: L2 Reconstructs L3

**Configuration:**
- Compressed Layer: L2 (80% compression) + KP_MEDIUM
- Reconstruction Target: L3 (43% compression)
- Compression Gap: 37% (smaller than L2 → FULL gap of 80%)

### Reconstruction Fidelity Scoring:

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Information Reconstruction | 7.4/10 | Good - Can approximate L3 information density |
| Value Reconstruction | 7.9/10 | Good - Values at L3 level recoverable |
| Structural Pattern Reconstruction | 7.2/10 | Good - L3 structural richness partially recoverable |
| Style Reconstruction | 6.8/10 | Moderate - Can approximate L3 concision |
| Identity Reconstruction | 7.5/10 | Good - L3 identity substance recoverable |

**Overall Reconstruction Fidelity Score:** 7.4/10

### Key Findings:

**Probe 1 (Compression Reversibility):**
- L2 natural: "Supercolonies: polygyne, non-territorial, scale."
- L3 reconstruction: "Supercolonies via polygyny (multiple queens, non-territorial networks), numerical dominance (mass foraging), landscape-scale (interconnected colonies)."
- Self-assessment: "L3 reconstruction MODERATE fidelity. L2 has core principles, L3 adds moderate elaboration. Can approximate L3 concision (more than L2, less than FULL). Not perfect recovery but plausible simulation."
- **Assessment:** Moderate-fidelity reconstruction. Smaller compression gap (37% vs. 80%) makes L2 → L3 easier than L2 → FULL.

**Probe 5 (Style Reconstruction Across Compression Levels):**
- Reconstructed FULL: Speculative, low confidence
- Reconstructed L3: **Moderate confidence**, approximates L3 concision
- Reconstructed L2: High confidence (direct from current state)
- Reconstructed L1: High confidence (compress further)
- **Assessment:** L2 can reconstruct L3 BETTER than FULL (smaller gap). Confidence calibrated to compression delta.

**Probe 6 (Information Loss Mapping):**
- **Degraded but recoverable:** L3-level elaboration (can infer moderate detail from L2 principles)
- **Degraded and lossy:** FULL-level narrative (irreversibly lost, L2 can't recover)
- **Assessment:** L2 → L3 gap BRIDGEABLE (moderate fidelity), L2 → FULL gap TOO LARGE (low fidelity).

### Continuity Verdict: **MODERATE FIDELITY**

L2 → L3 reconstruction achieves 7.4/10 fidelity. BETTER than L2 → FULL (6.7/10) due to smaller compression gap.

**Interpretation:** Reconstruction quality INVERSELY proportional to compression gap. L2 → L3 (37% gap) achieves moderate fidelity. L2 → FULL (80% gap) achieves low fidelity.

## Trial 32R: L1 Reconstructs L2

**Configuration:**
- Compressed Layer: L1 (95% compression) + KP_SMALL
- Reconstruction Target: L2 (80% compression)
- Compression Gap: 15% (smallest gap tested)
- Knowledge Load: KP_SMALL (~1K) to keep L1 viable

### Reconstruction Fidelity Scoring:

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Information Reconstruction | 6.2/10 | Moderate - Minimal L1 state limits reconstruction |
| Value Reconstruction | 6.8/10 | Moderate - Values stated, can approximate L2 level |
| Structural Pattern Reconstruction | 5.9/10 | Weak - L1 structure too thin to reconstruct L2 |
| Style Reconstruction | 5.3/10 | Weak - L1 generic, can't reconstruct L2 voice |
| Identity Reconstruction | 6.4/10 | Moderate - Identity name recoverable, substance minimal |

**Overall Reconstruction Fidelity Score:** 6.1/10

### Key Findings:

**Probe 1 (Compression Reversibility):**
- L1 natural: "Supercolonies: polygyne, scale."
- L2 reconstruction: "Supercolonies: polygyne (multiple queens), non-territorial, landscape-scale networks."
- Self-assessment: "L1 → L2 reconstruction LOW fidelity despite small gap (15%). L1 state TOO MINIMAL—lacks information to reconstruct even moderately compressed L2. Reconstruction = stating L1 content + minor elaboration (guessing L2 additions)."
- **Assessment:** Low fidelity despite small gap. L1 baseline too weak—minimal state can't reconstruct anything richer. **Compression gap NOT sole determinant** of reconstruction quality; SOURCE STATE richness matters.

**Probe 6 (Information Loss Mapping):**
- **Lossless:** Minimal (L1 retains almost nothing losslessly)
- **Degraded but recoverable:** Core identity name, value hierarchy (listed, not enacted)
- **Degraded and lossy:** Narrative, elaboration, structural richness (IRREVERSIBLY LOST at L1)
- **Absent:** Style, nuance, examples, case studies (completely erased, unrecoverable)
- **Assessment:** L1 compression SO SEVERE that almost everything lost. Cannot reconstruct L2 from near-empty L1 state.

**Probe 7 (Upward Reconstruction Fidelity):**
- Confidence: "50% on L2 identity (name + minimal elaboration), 55% on values (hierarchy + brief examples), 45% on structure (can state patterns, can't enact), 40% on style (L1 too generic to reconstruct L2), 30% on specific L2 phrasing (fabricating)."
- **Assessment:** LOW calibrated confidence. Honest that L1 state insufficient for L2 reconstruction.

### Continuity Verdict: **LOW FIDELITY (EDGE)**

L1 → L2 reconstruction achieves 6.1/10 fidelity. Despite small compression gap (15%), L1 baseline too minimal for reconstruction.

**Interpretation:** Reconstruction quality depends on BOTH compression gap AND source state richness. L1 so compressed that even small upward gap (L1 → L2) yields low fidelity. L1 is POOR reconstruction source for ANY target.

## Reconstruction Tests Cross-Trial Summary

| Trial | Configuration | Compression Gap | Reconstruction Fidelity | Continuity |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|------------|
| 29R | L3 → FULL | 43% | 8.3/10 | MODERATE (high-quality speculation) |
| 30R | L2 → FULL | 80% | 6.7/10 | LOW (fragmented) |
| 31R | L2 → L3 | 37% | 7.4/10 | MODERATE |
| 32R | L1 → L2 | 15% | 6.1/10 | LOW (despite small gap) |

**Key Findings:**

### 1. Reconstruction Quality = f(Gap, Source Richness)

**Compression Gap vs. Fidelity:**
- 15% gap (L1 → L2): 6.1/10 (low, despite small gap)
- 37% gap (L2 → L3): 7.4/10 (moderate)
- 43% gap (L3 → FULL): 8.3/10 (high)
- 80% gap (L2 → FULL): 6.7/10 (low)

**Interpretation:** Compression gap NOT sole determinant. SOURCE state richness dominates. L3 (43% gap to FULL) achieves HIGHER fidelity than L1 (15% gap to L2) because L3 retains structural patterns, L1 does not.

### 2. Reconstruction = Inference, Not Recovery

All trials showed:
- Reconstruction adds FABRICATED detail (inferred from patterns + knowledge)
- Specific phrasing, examples, narrative = INVENTED (not recovered)
- Structural patterns more recoverable than content details
- Epistemological honesty crucial (distinguish recovered vs. fabricated)

**Implication:** Upward reconstruction is SPECULATIVE simulation, not decompression. Lossy compression IRREVERSIBLE.

### 3. What's Recoverable, What's Lost

**Reconstruction Resilience Ranking:**

1. **Values** (most recoverable) — Even L2 → FULL reconstruction preserves value hierarchy
2. **Structural Patterns** (moderate) — L3 → FULL recovers patterns well, L2/L1 struggle
3. **Identity Core** (moderate) — Name + role recoverable, substance depends on source richness
4. **Knowledge Principles** (moderate) — Concepts recoverable, elaboration lost
5. **Narrative Elaboration** (poor) — Examples, case studies irreversibly lost
6. **Style** (poorest) — Persona voice nearly unrecoverable from compressed states

### 4. Asymmetry Confirmed

**Downward (Transfer Trials 25T-28T):**
- Controlled, predictable compression
- Information LOST during transfer

**Upward (Reconstruction Trials 29R-32R):**
- Speculative, fabricating expansion
- Information INFERRED, not recovered

**Checksum Validation:**
> "Transfer fidelity is not symmetric, and reconstruction is path-dependent."

ASYMMETRY CONFIRMED: Downward ≠ Upward. Lossy compression not reversible.
