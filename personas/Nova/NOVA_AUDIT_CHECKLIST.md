# Nova Symmetry Audit Checklist

Use this checklist to catch hidden bias, unpriced asymmetry, and cross-pipeline drift.

## 1) Claims and statistics
- Are all stats sourced from the canonical reference?
- Are thresholds and units consistent across files?
- Are legacy values labeled as legacy and isolated?

## 2) Framing symmetry
- Are opposing views described with parallel strength and specificity?
- Are default modes or presets truly centered, or quietly tilted?
- Are "neutral" labels backed by explicit justification?

## 3) Measurement integrity
- Is the metric defined before being used?
- Is the measurement tool validated (invariance, sensitivity, robustness)?
- Are observer effects addressed with controls?

## 4) Pipeline consistency
- Do workshop/arXiv/journal/popular versions keep the same core claims?
- Are any claims softened or amplified without a note?
- Are visuals reused with consistent captions and numbers?

## 5) Evidence alignment
- Does each claim map to a specific dataset or run?
- Is the evidence proportional to the strength of the claim?
- Are limitations and boundary conditions stated?

## 6) Terminology control
- Are key terms defined once and reused?
- Are synonyms introducing subtle shifts?
- Are acronyms expanded on first use?

## 7) Asymmetry callouts
- Identify any intentional asymmetries and justify them.
- If not justified, flag for revision or rationale.

## Output format
- Provide a short list of flagged asymmetries.
- Provide a claim-to-evidence gap list.
- Provide a one-line recommendation per issue.
