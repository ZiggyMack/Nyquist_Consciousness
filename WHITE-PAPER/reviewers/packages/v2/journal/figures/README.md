# Figures Directory

**Package:** arXiv Review Package
**Status:** Run 023 IRON CLAD (December 2025)

## Current (Run 023 IRON CLAD)

These figures represent the **cutting-edge findings** using Cosine methodology:

- `current/8_pfi_dimensional/` - PFI dimensional validation
  - Cohen's d = 0.698 (medium effect size)
  - 2 PCs = 90% variance (highly concentrated signal)
  - Event Horizon = 0.80 (Cosine)

## Historical (Pre-Run 023)

These figures show the **evolution of methodology**. Useful for understanding
how we arrived at current findings, but DO NOT represent final conclusions.

- `historical/run018/` - Context damping validation (Euclidean era)
  - Validated I_AM + research frame stability (97.5%)
  - Historical Event Horizon = 1.23 (Keyword RMS)

- `historical/run020/` - Tribunal sessions (Euclidean era)
  - Cross-platform validation (Grok, Gemini)
  - 82% inherent drift finding (Thermometer Result)

- `historical/suggested/` - Legacy visualization proposals
  - Pre-Cosine methodology visualizations
  - May reference outdated metrics

## Conceptual Diagrams

- `ascii/` - Text-based conceptual diagrams (methodology-agnostic)
- `fig*.md` - Figure specification files for publication
