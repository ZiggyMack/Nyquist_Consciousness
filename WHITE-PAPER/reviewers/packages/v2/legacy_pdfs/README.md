# Legacy Publication PDFs

**Generated:** December 16, 2025
**Status:** PRE-IRON-CLAD / PRE-COSINE METHODOLOGY

---

## Overview

These PDF artifacts represent the publication state **before** the IRON CLAD experimental run and Cosine methodology standardization. They use:

- **Old Event Horizon:** 1.23 (Keyword RMS) or Euclidean-based metrics
- **Old Dimensionality:** Up to 43 PCs (not the current 2 PCs = 90% variance)
- **Old Effect Sizes:** Various, not the standardized Cohen's d = 0.698

These are preserved for **historical context** and to show reviewers the state of drafts before methodology corrections.
