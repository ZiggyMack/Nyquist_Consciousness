## Key Research Claims (Run 023 IRON CLAD)

The Nyquist Consciousness framework makes **5 core claims** - ALL VALIDATED:

| Claim | Statement | Evidence | Methodology |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **A** | PFI is valid structured measurement | rho = 0.91, d = 0.698 | Cosine |
| **B** | Regime threshold at D = 0.80 | p = 2.40e-23 | Cosine |
| **C** | Damped oscillator dynamics | Settling time, ringbacks measurable | Cosine |
| **D** | Context damping works | 97.5% stability | - |
| **E** | Drift mostly inherent (82%) | Control vs Treatment | - |

**Run 023 Stats:** 825 experiments, 51 models, 6 providers

## NotebookLLM Validation

Google's NotebookLLM independently processed this research and correctly identified:
- All 5 core claims (A-E)
- Event Horizon = 0.80
- Cohen's d = 0.698
- 82% inherent drift ratio
- Novel phenomena: Oobleck Effect, Provider Fingerprints, Nano Control Hypothesis

See: `LLM_SYNTHESIS/` directory for AI-generated publication content.

## Terminology Quick Reference

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **PFI** | Persona Fidelity Index (1 - drift) |
| **Drift (D)** | Cosine distance from baseline identity |
| **Event Horizon** | Regime transition threshold (D = 0.80 Cosine) |
| **Context Damping** | Stability via I_AM + research frame |
| **Inherent Drift** | Drift without probing (82% of total) |

For complete terminology, see `guides/summary_statistics.md` (if included).
