## Included Maps

### ARMADA_MAP.md
Fleet structure for cross-architecture identity testing:
- 49 operational ships (91% of 54 total)
- 5 providers: Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, xAI, Together.ai
- Cost tier system (Budget → Yacht)
- Fleet options for different budgets

### TESTABLE_PREDICTIONS_MATRIX.md
All falsifiable predictions across S0-S10:
- **Claims A-E** (NotebookLLM synthesis)
- Validation status for each prediction
- Evidence mapping to experimental runs
- **Updated for Run 023 COSINE methodology** (December 2025)

---

## Methodology Note

These maps use the **current Cosine methodology**:
- Event Horizon = 0.80 (Cosine distance)
- Cohen's d = 0.698 (medium effect size)
- 2 PCs = 90% variance

Historical references to Keyword RMS (EH=1.23) or Euclidean (43 PCs)
are preserved for context but superseded by Cosine findings.

## Single Source of Truth

For methodology details, see the authoritative reference:

**`experiments/temporal_stability/S7_ARMADA/0_docs/specs/5_METHODOLOGY_DOMAINS.md`**

This document explains the evolution:
- Keyword RMS (EH=1.23) → Euclidean (43 PCs) → **Cosine (EH=0.80, 2 PCs)**
- Why Cosine is the PRIMARY methodology
- Reconciliation of historical vs current metrics
