# 4_DEEP_DIVES

Extended analysis generated during `--full` ingestion mode.

## Purpose

When `ingest.py --ingest --full` is run, Claude generates deep-dive analysis:
- Cross-references between documents
- Methodology deep-dives
- Extended explanations of complex concepts
- Connections to source experiments

## Generation

This directory is populated by Claude during full ingestion review.
Files here represent synthesis beyond the lite REVIEW_NOTES.md.
