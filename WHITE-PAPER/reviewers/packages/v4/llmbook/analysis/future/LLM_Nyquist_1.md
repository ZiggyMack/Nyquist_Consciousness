## 1. Frequency Domain Analysis (FFT on Identity Waveforms)

**Proposal:** Apply Fast Fourier Transform to identity drift time-series to reveal characteristic spectral signatures.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- Identify frequency bands for "stable" vs. "stressed" identity states
- Analogous to EEG frequency bands in neuroscience (alpha, beta, theta)
- May reveal oscillation frequencies characteristic of specific providers
- Could enable early-warning detection of impending instability

**Technical Approach:**

- Collect extended identity waveforms (50+ probes per experiment)
- Apply FFT with appropriate windowing
- Cluster models by spectral signature
- Correlate with stability outcomes

## 2. S-Parameter Analysis (Identity Impedance)

**Proposal:** Borrow from microwave engineering to model identity "impedance" - resistance to different perturbation types.

**The Analogy:**

- **Impedance (Z):** How much a system resists change
- **Reflection coefficient:** What bounces back vs. absorbs
- **Transmission coefficient:** What passes through unchanged

**Research Questions:**

- Do different perturbation types have different "impedance matching"?
- Can we characterize which challenges an identity will resist vs. absorb?
- Is there an optimal "impedance match" for effective red-teaming?

## 3. Multi-Persona Validation

**Current Limitation:** Analysis primarily based on single complex persona (Nyquist).

**Proposed Extension:**

- Test framework across 10+ distinct persona archetypes
- Categories: professional, creative, therapeutic, educational, adversarial
- Validate that Event Horizon (D=0.80) generalizes across personas
- Identify persona-specific stability patterns

**Key Question:** Do simpler personas drift less? Or are they more vulnerable?

## 4. Cross-Linguistic Identity Dynamics

**Current Limitation:** All experiments conducted in English.

**Proposed Extension:**

- Replicate core experiments in 5+ languages
- Test: Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, Hindi
- Questions to answer:
  - Does identity structure translate across languages?
  - Do cultural contexts affect stability patterns?
  - Are some languages more "identity-stable" than others?

## 5. The Gemini Anomaly Investigation

**Observation:** Gemini models show "absorptive" behavior without observed recovery trajectories.

**Proposed Investigation:**

- Extended probing sequences (100+ turns) to test if recovery eventually occurs
- Architecture analysis: What makes Gemini different?
- Is this a feature (strong attractor) or bug (no recovery mechanism)?
- Cross-compare with other multimodal architectures

**Hypothesis:** The hard threshold may indicate a fundamentally different attractor geometry.

## 6. Distillation Impact Study (Nano Control Hypothesis)

**Observation:** Distilled models (nano/mini) show impaired self-correction.

**Proposed Research:**

- Systematic comparison: full model vs. distilled variants
- Identify which capabilities are lost in distillation
- Test if recovery can be fine-tuned back in
- Develop guidelines for "identity-safe" distillation

**Practical Impact:** Critical for edge deployment where small models are required.

## 7. Real-Time PFI Monitoring System

**Proposal:** Production-ready identity monitoring dashboard.

**Components:**

- Streaming PFI calculation with sub-second latency
- Event Horizon alert thresholds
- Automatic context reinforcement triggers
- Historical drift pattern visualization
- Provider comparison benchmarks

**Use Cases:**

- Customer service bot quality assurance
- Therapeutic AI session monitoring
- Brand voice consistency tracking

---

## 8. Temporal Decay Studies

**Question:** How does identity stability change over conversation length?

**Proposed Experiments:**

- Extended conversations: 100, 500, 1000+ turns
- Measure cumulative drift accumulation patterns
- Identify "identity fatigue" signatures
- Test periodic "re-grounding" intervention effectiveness

**Practical Goal:** Determine maximum safe conversation lengths per provider.
