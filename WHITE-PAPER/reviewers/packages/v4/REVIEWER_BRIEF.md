## Core Research Claims (ALL VALIDATED)

The framework makes **5 core claims** validated across 750 experiments, 25 models, 5 providers:

| Claim | Statement | Evidence | Status |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **A** | PFI is valid structured measurement | ρ = 0.91, d = 0.698 | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| **B** | Regime threshold at cosine = 0.80 | p = 2.40e-23 | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| **C** | Damped oscillator dynamics | Settling time ~6 turns | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| **D** | Context damping works | 97.5% stability | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| **E** | Drift mostly inherent (92%) | Control vs Treatment | ✅ CONFIRMED |

**Methodology:** IRON CLAD (Cosine similarity, Event Horizon = 0.80)

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Total experiments** | 750 | Run 023 COMBINED |
| **Models tested** | 25 | Fleet across 5 providers |
| **Providers** | 5 | Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Together |
| **Event Horizon** | 0.80 | Cosine similarity threshold |
| **Cohen's d** | 0.698 | Model-level effect size (MEDIUM) |
| **PCs for 90% variance** | 2 | Identity is low-dimensional |
| **Perturbation p-value** | 2.40e-23 | Highly significant |
| **Inherent drift** | 92% | "Measurement perturbs path, not endpoint" |

---

## Methodology Evolution

**Historical Note:** This research evolved through three methodology domains:

| Domain | Event Horizon | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Keyword RMS** | 1.23 | HISTORICAL (Runs 008-009 only) |
| **Euclidean Embedding** | N/A | DEPRECATED |
| **Cosine Embedding** | **0.80** | **PRIMARY** ✅ |

References to "1.23" in some documents refer to the historical Keyword RMS methodology. All current claims use the **Cosine methodology with Event Horizon = 0.80**.

## Novel Phenomena Discovered

### The Oobleck Effect
Identity resists rate-dependently: gentle questioning causes more drift (identity flows away), while direct challenges cause less drift (identity "hardens").

### Provider Fingerprints
Different training philosophies leave geometric signatures in drift space:
- **Constitutional AI (Claude):** Hard uniform boundaries
- **RLHF (OpenAI):** Variable, soft boundaries

### Recovery Paradox
Crossing the Event Horizon (cosine < 0.80) is NOT fatal — 100% of models recovered once pressure was removed.

## Recommended Review Approach

### For Academic Review (arXiv/Journal)
1. Start with `arxiv/README.md`
2. Read `arxiv/theory/MINIMUM_PUBLISHABLE_CLAIMS.md`
3. Review `arxiv/planning/METHODOLOGY_DOMAINS.md`
4. Check `visualization_pdfs/` for visual evidence
5. Provide feedback in `feedback/`

### For Quick Assessment
1. Read this brief
2. Skim `visualization_pdfs/` (especially Oobleck, Thermometer, PCA visualizations)
3. Note questions in `feedback/`
