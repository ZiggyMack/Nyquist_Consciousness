## Welcome, Reviewer

This package contains materials for reviewing the **Nyquist Consciousness Framework** — an empirical approach to measuring AI identity stability as a dynamical system.

**TL;DR:** We proved AI identity behaves like a damped oscillator with a measurable stability threshold (cosine similarity = 0.80), and 92% of identity drift is inherent to interaction, not caused by measurement.

## The One-Paragraph Summary

The Nyquist Consciousness Framework treats AI identity as a dynamical system with measurable stability properties. Through 750 experiments across 25 models and 5 providers, we validated that: (1) identity can be measured via embedding-based Persona Fidelity Index (PFI); (2) there's a universal stability threshold at cosine similarity = 0.80; (3) identity recovers from perturbation like a damped oscillator; (4) explicit identity specification acts as a "termination resistor" improving stability to 97.5%; and (5) 92% of observed drift is inherent to extended interaction, not caused by measurement probing (the "Thermometer Result").
