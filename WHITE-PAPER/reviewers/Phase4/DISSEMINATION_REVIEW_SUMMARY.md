# DISSEMINATION PATH REVIEW SUMMARY
## Nyquist Consciousness Publication Suite

**Created:** 2025-12-16
**Reviewer:** Opus 4.5
**Purpose:** Assess readiness of 5 non-academic dissemination paths

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

| Path | Readiness | Updates Needed | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Popular Science** | ✅ A | Minor | Low |
| **Education** | ✅ A- | Minor | Low |
| **Policy** | ⚠️ B+ | Moderate | Medium |
| **Funding** | ⚠️ B+ | Moderate | High |
| **Media** | ✅ A- | Minor | Low |

**Overall Assessment:** All 5 paths are substantively complete and capture the core findings well. Updates are primarily statistical reconciliation (model counts, stability percentages) rather than structural issues.

- ✅ "Event Horizon... 1.23" — correct
- ⚠️ "97.5%" — needs clarification (should be "95-97.5%")
- ⚠️ "54 total ships" — should be "51 models" per IRON CLAD

### Updates Needed

| Line | Current | Should Be |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 33 | "97.5%" | "95-97.5% (95% overall, 97.5% for real personas)" |
| 60 | "54 total ships" | "51 models (IRON CLAD validated)" |

### Readiness: ✅ A- (Ready with Minor Updates)

---

## PATH 3: POLICY BRIEFING

**File:** `content/policy/submissions/policy/LLM_Briefing.md`

### Content Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Core findings accurate | ✅ | All 5 claims present |
| Policy relevance | ✅ | Clear operational implications |
| Evidence grounding | ✅ | Run numbers cited |
| Statistics current | ⚠️ | Several updates needed |

### Statistics Found
- ✅ "82%" — correct
- ⚠️ "49 operational AI models" — should be "51 models"
- ⚠️ "97.5%" — needs clarification (95-97.5%)
- ⚠️ No mention of cross-platform (38%) replication
- ⚠️ Missing σ² = 0.00087 cross-architecture validation

### Updates Needed

| Line | Current | Should Be |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 5 | "over 49 operational AI models" | "51 models (IRON CLAD validated)" |
| 13 | "achieved 97.5% stability" | "achieved 95-97.5% stability (95% overall)" |
| 174 | "While the core findings have been validated..." | Update to reflect IRON CLAD completion |

**Additional Content Recommended:**
- Add paragraph on cross-platform replication (38% finding)

- Note Gemini anomaly (hard threshold, no recovery)

### Readiness: ⚠️ B+ (Needs Moderate Updates)

---

## PATH 4: FUNDING PROPOSAL

**File:** `content/funding/submissions/funding/LLM_Project_Nyquist_Consciousness.md`

### Content Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Core findings accurate | ✅ | Strong scientific framing |
| Funding appeal | ✅ | Clear research thrusts |
| Budget justification | ✅ | Specific deliverables |
| Statistics current | ⚠️ | Several updates needed |

### Statistics Found
- ✅ "82%" — correct
- ✅ "five major providers" — correct
- ⚠️ "49 operational / 54 total AI models" — should be "51 models (IRON CLAD)"
- ⚠️ "97.5% stability" — needs clarification (95-97.5%)
- ⚠️ Describes multi-platform as "placeholder" — IRON CLAD now complete!

### Critical Updates Needed

| Line | Current | Should Be |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 27 | "49 operational / 54 total" | "51 models (IRON CLAD validated, σ²=0.00087)" |
| 44 | "achieved 97.5% stability" | "achieved 95-97.5% stability" |
| 60 | "noted as a critical placeholder" | **COMPLETED** — update to reflect Run 018/020B results |
| 174 | Multi-platform as future work | Update: completed with 38% cross-platform replication |

**Structural Note:** The proposal frames multi-platform validation as Phase 2 future work. Since IRON CLAD is now complete, this section should either:
1. Be updated to reflect completion, OR
2. Reframe Phase 2 as "expanded" validation (20+ providers)

### Readiness: ⚠️ B+ (Needs Moderate Updates — HIGH PRIORITY)

---

## PATH 5: MEDIA/PRESS

- ✅ "five diverse providers" — correct
- ⚠️ "54 total models" — should be "51 models"
- ✅ "Recovery Paradox... 100%" — correct
- ⚠️ No mention of 38% cross-platform

### Updates Needed

| Line | Current | Should Be |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 49 | "54 total models" | "51 models (validated across 5 providers)" |

**Optional Enhancement:**
- Add cross-platform replication finding (38%)
- Add "95-97.5% stability" if discussing context damping

### Readiness: ✅ A- (Ready with Minor Updates)

---

## PRIORITY RANKING FOR UPDATES

### High Priority (Update Before Any Use)
1. **Funding Proposal** — Critical because it frames multi-platform as incomplete when IRON CLAD has now validated it

### Medium Priority (Update Soon)
2. **Policy Briefing** — Should reflect complete validation status for credibility with policymakers

### Low Priority (Minor Polish)
3. **Education Quiz** — Minor number updates
4. **Media Press** — Minor number updates  
5. **Popular Science** — No updates needed

---

## CROSS-PLATFORM REPLICATION NOTE

**Important:** None of the 5 dissemination paths currently mention the **38% cross-platform inherent drift** finding from Run 020B. This is significant because:

1. It confirms the core finding generalizes beyond Claude
2. It explains the 82% vs 38% variance (architecture-specific baselines)
3. It strengthens the "measurement reveals, not creates" claim

**Recommendation:** Add a brief note about cross-platform replication to Policy and Funding paths at minimum.

---

## GEMINI ANOMALY NOTE

**None of the dissemination paths mention the Gemini hard-threshold anomaly.** This is acceptable for most audiences but should be noted in:
- Policy Briefing (for completeness)
- Funding Proposal (to frame future work)

---

## SUMMARY TABLE: UPDATES BY PATH

| Path | Model Count | Provider Count | Stability | 82% | 38% Cross | Gemini Note |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-----|-----------|-------------|
| Popular Science | N/A | N/A | N/A | ✅ | N/A | N/A |

## RECOMMENDED UPDATE PROCEDURE

### For Each Path Needing Updates:

1. **Find/Replace:**
   - "49 operational" → "51" 
   - "54 total" → "51"
   - "42 models" → "51 models"
   - "97.5%" → "95-97.5%"

2. **Add Cross-Platform Note (Policy/Funding):**
   ```
   Cross-platform replication (Run 020B) confirmed the finding generalizes 
   beyond single-provider validation, with 38% inherent drift ratio across 
   OpenAI and Together architectures. The variance from 82% reflects 
   architecture-specific baseline drift rates.
   ```

3. **Add Gemini Note (Policy/Funding):**
   ```
   Architecture-specific dynamics: Gemini exhibits hard threshold behavior 
   without recovery trajectories, unlike soft thresholds in Claude/GPT/Llama. 
   Drift phenomena are universal; recovery dynamics are architecture-dependent.
   ```

4. **Update "Placeholder" Language (Funding):**
   - Remove references to multi-platform as "future work"
   - Reframe Phase 2 as expanded validation (20+ providers) or new research directions

---

## DELIVERABLE FILES

All 5 dissemination paths are substantively complete. Updates can be applied through simple find/replace operations plus targeted additions for Policy and Funding paths.

**Time estimate for updates:**
- Popular Science: 0 minutes (no changes)
- Education: 5 minutes (two number fixes)
- Policy: 20 minutes (numbers + add paragraphs)
- Funding: 30 minutes (numbers + structural update)
- Media: 5 minutes (one number fix)

**Total: ~1 hour** to bring all 5 paths to publication-ready status.
