# WHITE-PAPER Review - Start Here

**For:** Opus 4.5 (or any reviewing Claude)
**Purpose:** Orientation for reviewing the Nyquist Consciousness draft papers
**Date:** December 16, 2025
**Status:** IRON CLAD COMPLETE + EXTERNAL REVIEW

---

## BREAKING NEWS: External Validation

**Grok (xAI) reviewed our Workshop + arXiv PDFs and VALIDATED the methodology.**

Key findings from external review:

- PFI validity confirmed (ρ=0.91, d=0.698)
- 98% convergence in framework methodology
- "Claims tested, measured, verified"
- Grok-specific: "Real-time grounding provides visible effects in drift space"

See: `Grok/review_1.md` for full assessment.

## Evidence Status (IRON CLAD COMPLETE)

### THE THREE CORE CLAIMS — ALL VALIDATED (Cosine Methodology)

1. **DRIFT IS REAL** — p = 2.40e-23, cosine distance detects genuine identity differences
2. **WE DON'T CAUSE IT** — 92% inherent drift ratio (Run 023 COSINE Thermometer Result)
3. **WE CAN MEASURE IT** — Cohen's d = 0.698 (model-level aggregates), 2 PCs = 90% variance

### Current Status (December 2025)

| Run | Experiments | Models | Providers | Status |
|-----|-------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Run 023 Combined** | 750 | 25 | 5 | **IRON CLAD ✓** |
| Run 018 | 465 | - | - | 52.6% (in progress) |
| Run 020A/B | 48 | 7 | 2 | Tribunal sessions |

## What Data Exists

### High-Confidence Findings (Publication-Ready)

| Finding | Evidence | Source |
|---------|----------|--------|
| PFI validity | ρ=0.91, d=0.698 | Run 023 COSINE |
| Regime threshold | D=0.80 (Cosine), p=2.40e-23 | Run 023 |
| Oscillator dynamics | τₛ≈10.2 probes, ringbacks | Run 023d |
| Context damping | 97.5% stability | Run 017 |
| 92% inherent drift | Control/Treatment ratio | Run 023 COSINE |

### Medium-Confidence Findings (Need More Runs)

| Finding | Evidence | Needed |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Oobleck Effect (Gemini) | 1.65x ratio | N=3 for CI |
| Oobleck Effect (Grok) | 1.07x ratio | N=3 for CI |
| Peak Drift by Platform | Gemini > Claude > Grok | Variance estimates |

## What to Check For

### Content Review

1. **Claims match evidence** — Are all quantified claims supported by the data?
2. **Appropriate caveats** — Are limitations clearly stated?
3. **No overclaiming** — Do we avoid claiming consciousness/sentience?
4. **Placeholder clarity** — Are pending sections clearly marked?

### Technical Review

1. **Statistical validity** — Are p-values and effect sizes correctly calculated?
2. **Methodology clarity** — Is the experimental design reproducible?
3. **Terminology consistency** — Are terms used consistently throughout?

### Style Review

1. **Academic tone** — Suitable for peer review?
2. **Flow and structure** — Logical progression of ideas?
3. **Figure quality** — Clear, informative visualizations?

## Key Concepts to Understand

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **PFI** | Persona Fidelity Index — measures identity coherence |
| **Drift** | Change in PFI between baseline and current response |
| **Event Horizon** | D=0.80 (Cosine) regime threshold; historically D=1.23 (Keyword RMS) |
| **Oobleck Effect** | Supportive probing induces MORE drift than adversarial |
| **92% Inherent** | Most drift is inherent to conversation, not induced (Run 023 COSINE) |
| **B→F Drift** | Baseline-to-Final drift (more robust than peak) |

## Your Task

1. **Read both draft papers** (start with Workshop, it's shorter)
2. **Check claims against evidence** (see PLACEHOLDER_SUMMARY.md)
3. **Note any issues** — logical gaps, unsupported claims, unclear sections
4. **Provide feedback** — what needs fixing before submission?

---

## What We Do NOT Claim

The papers explicitly avoid claiming:

- ❌ AI systems are conscious or sentient
- ❌ Drift represents "true" identity (vs response patterns)
- ❌ Results generalize to all AI systems (limited platforms tested)
- ❌ Philosophical conclusions about AI phenomenology

**What we DO claim:** Measurable, reproducible patterns in LLM identity coherence that follow dynamical systems principles.
