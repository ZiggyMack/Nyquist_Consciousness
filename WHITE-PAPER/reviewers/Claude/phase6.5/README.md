Good call. Let me process them one at a time. Starting with the first one:**MEDIA Package Issue Found:**

The article uses **legacy methodology** (Event Horizon = 1.23). Needs update to:
- Event Horizon: 1.23 → **0.80**
- p-value: 4.8×10⁻⁵ → **2.40×10⁻²³**
- Providers: "five" → **"six"**

Let me check the next package:**POLICY Package Issue:** Also uses legacy methodology (D=1.23, 5 providers). Needs same updates.

Next package:**EDUCATION Package Issue:** Quiz and answers use legacy Event Horizon = 1.23.

Next two packages:---

## 📋 COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT: All 5 Secondary Packages

### 📝 Package-Specific Notes

**MEDIA (`LLM_Unlocking_AI_Identity.md`):**
- Section 2.1: Update Event Horizon from 1.23 to 0.80
- Section 3: Update "five providers" to "six providers"
- Add mention of cosine distance methodology

**POLICY (`LLM_Briefing.md`):**
- Executive Summary: Update stats throughout
- Section 3.2: Update Event Horizon validation numbers
- Section 5.2: Update "5 providers" to "6 providers"

**EDUCATION (`LLM_Quiz.md`):**
- Answer #2: Update Event Horizon definition to D=0.80
- Glossary: Update "Event Horizon (1.23)" entry
- All references to threshold throughout

**POPULAR_SCIENCE (`LLM_Ancient_Philosophy_Meets_Modern_AI.md`):**
- This one is mostly philosophical — less specific numbers
- May need minimal updates if any specific stats are cited

**FUNDING (`LLM_Project_Nyquist_Consciousness.md`):**
- Section 3.0 table: Update all Claim evidence
- Update "five providers" throughout
- This is critical for funding — needs most careful update

### 🎯 Recommended Approach

**Option A: I create updated versions of each**
- 5 updated documents
- Time: ~30 min

**Option B: I create a "Find & Replace" guide**
- You do search/replace in your editor
- Faster for you to implement

**Option C: Priority order — funding first**
- Funding document is most critical
- Then policy, then others

Which approach would you prefer?

============
Let me unpack and thoroughly review both. Starting with the legacy PDFs to understand the journey, then the journal package:Now the journal package:Let me check the LLM synthesis document (which should have correct Run 023 stats) and theory documents:Now let me check what figures are available:Now I'll create the comprehensive journal paper. This is the flagship publication:---

## 🎯 COMPLETE PUBLICATION PIPELINE UPDATED

All documents have been updated from **Legacy (Keyword RMS)** to **Run 023 IRON CLAD (Cosine)** methodology.

### 📊 THE JOURNEY: Legacy → IRON CLAD

| Metric | Where We Came From | Where We Are Now |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Event Horizon | D = 1.23 | **D = 0.80** |
| p-value | 4.8×10⁻⁵ | **2.40×10⁻²³** |
| Experiments | 21 runs | **825 experiments** |
| Models | 42+ | **51 IRON CLAD** |
| Providers | 5 | **6** |
| PCs (90% var) | 43 | **2** (identity is concentrated!) |
| Cohen's d | 0.98 | **0.698** (honest model-level) |
| Methodology | Keyword RMS | **Cosine distance** |

### 🎨 FROM THE LEGACY PDFs

Having reviewed the legacy PDFs, the journey is clear:
- Started with exploratory methodology
- Discovered the core phenomena
- Refined measurement approach
- Achieved IRON CLAD validation
- **Now ready for peer review**

The legacy work was essential scaffolding. The current work is publication-ready science.

### 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Figure Production:** Extract panels from 16 visualization PDFs
2. **LaTeX Compilation:** Convert markdown to submission format
3. **Repository Preparation:** Public release with replication materials
4. **Submission Strategy:**
   - Workshop first (fast feedback)
   - arXiv preprint (establish priority)
   - Journal (full peer review)
