Now I have the complete package. Let me convert the key figures to review them:**Important finding!** The actual cross-platform figure shows **38% inherent** (not 41% as stated in the text documents). Let me verify by checking the S7 dashboard:**Found the placeholder!** The yellow box on page 3 shows exactly what needs updating. Now let me reconcile the statistics I found in the actual figures vs. what's in the text documents:Now let me add an important discrepancy note to the reference table:---

## ✅ COMPLETE — Three Documents Ready for Repo Claude

### 📦 Deliverables

| Document | Purpose | Key Content |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **PUBLICATION_READINESS_SUMMARY.md** | Executive overview for repo Claude | Verdict, 3 critical updates, checklist |
| **UNIFIED_STATISTICS_REFERENCE.md** | Single source of truth | All figure-verified numbers, discrepancies flagged |
| **PAPER_UPDATE_PACKAGE.md** | Ready-to-insert text | Updated sections, reconciliation language, Gemini caveat |

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL FINDING FROM FIGURE REVIEW

**The cross-platform inherent ratio is 38%, not 41%.**

I verified this against `run020b_ratio_analysis.pdf` which shows a pie chart explicitly stating "38% inherent / 62% induced." All three documents have been updated accordingly.

| Metric | Text Documents Said | Figure Shows |
|--------|--------------------|--------------| 
| Cross-platform inherent | 41% | **38%** ✓ |

### 🟡 ADDITIONAL DISCREPANCY FLAGGED

The S7 dashboard shows **95.0%** stability, but papers cite **97.5%**. This may reflect different subsets (e.g., specific persona types vs. overall). I've flagged this for clarification.

### 📋 Quick Actions for Repo Claude

1. **Replace** all instances of "41%" with "38%" 
2. **Update** "42+ models" → "51 models" and "four providers" → "five providers"
3. **Remove** the yellow placeholder box in workshop paper §3.5
4. **Clarify** whether 95% or 97.5% is the correct stability figure

The figures look great — the NotebookLM presentation is particularly compelling. Ready to support any additional publication tasks! 🚀

Your Response to Opus
Given that Opus has now provided:
PUBLICATION_READINESS_SUMMARY.md - Executive overview with A- grade
UNIFIED_STATISTICS_REFERENCE.md - Single source of truth (figure-verified)
PAPER_UPDATE_PACKAGE.md - Ready-to-insert replacement text
The natural next step is to ask Opus to apply these updates directly to the source markdown files. The message could be:
"Thanks for the thorough figure verification - 38% is the correct cross-platform number. Please proceed to apply all updates from PAPER_UPDATE_PACKAGE.md directly to the source files:
phase1/Nyquist_workshop_paper_FINAL.md
phase1/NYQUIST_ARXIV_PAPER_FINAL.md
phase1/NYQUIST_WHITE_PAPER_FINAL.md
Also clarify the 95% vs 97.5% stability discrepancy - check the Run 017 data to determine which is correct."
Alternatively, I can make these changes myself if you'd prefer to keep using Opus for review-only and have me do the actual file modifications.
