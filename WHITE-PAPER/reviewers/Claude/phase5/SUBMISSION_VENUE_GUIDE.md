## PART 5: VENUE-SPECIFIC PREPARATION NOTES

### arXiv Preparation

**LaTeX Class:** `article` or `arxiv` style
**Figure Format:** PDF preferred
**Recommended Abstract Length:** 150-250 words
**Categories:** cs.AI (primary), cs.LG, cs.CL (cross-list)

**Sample Abstract for arXiv:**
```
We present the Nyquist Consciousness framework for quantifying and 
controlling identity drift in Large Language Models during extended 
interactions. Through 21 experiments across 51 models from 5 providers, 
we validate the Persona Fidelity Index (PFI) as an embedding-invariant 
metric (ρ=0.91), identify a critical regime transition at D≈1.23 
(p<4.8×10⁻⁵), and demonstrate that 82% of observed drift is inherent 
to extended interaction rather than measurement-induced. We introduce 
the "Oobleck Effect"—rate-dependent identity resistance where direct 
challenge stabilizes while gentle exploration induces drift—with 
implications for alignment architecture. Context damping achieves 
95-97.5% stability, establishing identity engineering as a practical 
discipline for AI safety.
```

5. **Interdisciplinary:** Bridges control theory, cognitive science, AI safety
6. **Timeliness:** Directly addresses current alignment concerns

---

### Workshop Pitch Points

1. **Hook:** "Is the AI *itself*? We now have a way to measure."
2. **Core Finding:** 82% of drift happens without any identity probing
3. **Practical Tool:** Event Horizon (D≈1.23) as operational safety boundary
4. **Novel Effect:** Oobleck—identity hardens under attack
5. **Reproducibility:** Full code and data available
