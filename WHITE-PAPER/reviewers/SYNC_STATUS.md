## Key Decisions Needed

### 1. Levin/Platonic Integration

**Question:** Should LLM_BOOK insights (NotebookLM's independent validation of Levin's Platonic hypothesis) be integrated into the white paper and arXiv NOW, or saved for a second publication?

**Arguments for NOW:**
- Strengthens theoretical foundation
- External AI validation adds credibility
- Content already written by NotebookLM

**Arguments for LATER:**
- Keep initial papers focused on empirical claims (A-E)
- Save philosophical extension for follow-up paper
- Avoid scope creep in nearly-finished drafts

**Status:** Awaiting Opus 4.5 decision

---

### 2. Popular Science Timing

**Question:** Should popular science articles be released simultaneously with academic papers, or wait until after peer review?

**Options:**
- A) Simultaneous (maximize impact)
- B) Wait for peer review (maximize credibility)
- C) Staged release (arXiv first, then popular)

**Status:** Awaiting Opus 4.5 recommendation

---

### 3. Education Materials Licensing

**Question:** Should educational materials be released as OER (Creative Commons) or through commercial platforms?

**Options:**
- A) Full OER (CC BY-SA 4.0)
- B) Commercial (Coursera/EdX partnership)
- C) Hybrid (basics free, advanced paid)

**Status:** Awaiting discussion
