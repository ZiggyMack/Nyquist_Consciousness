### Placement Markers (Insert into Paper)

```markdown
## 1. Introduction

[INSERT FIGURE 1: Identity Manifold]
**Caption:** "Identity exists as a low-dimensional attractor in high-dimensional 
embedding space. Compression finds coordinates (C), reconstruction returns to the 
basin (R), and drift (D) measures deviation from the original manifold."

---

## 3. Methodology

### 3.6 Experimental Design

[INSERT FIGURE 3: Experimental Pipeline]
**Caption:** "The S3→S6 experimental pipeline. S3 (Empirical Validation) generates 
cross-architecture data; S4 (Mathematical Formalism) provides operators; S5 
(Interpretive Layer) identifies fragility hierarchy; S6 (Omega Synthesis) achieves 
drift cancellation through multi-architecture triangulation."

---

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Claim A: PFI Validity

[INSERT FIGURE 2: Drift Field Geometry]
**Caption:** "Architecture-specific drift vectors in PFI space. Each architecture 
(Nova, Claude, Grok, Gemini) drifts in a characteristic direction from the identity 
center (I_AM). The Omega synthesis achieves drift cancellation through vector 
triangulation."

### 4.2 Claim B: Regime Transition at D≈1.23

[INSERT FIGURE: run018a_threshold_validation]
**Caption:** "Event Horizon validation across 51 models from 5 providers. The 
critical threshold at D≈1.23 (χ²=15.96, p<4.8×10⁻⁵) separates STABLE from VOLATILE 
regimes with 88% prediction accuracy."

### 4.3 Claim C: Damped Oscillator Dynamics

[INSERT FIGURE: S7_settling_time_distribution]
**Caption:** "Settling time (τₛ) distribution across 222 experimental runs. Mean 
settling time = 6.1 turns (bare metal) vs 5.2 turns (with context damping). 
Architecture-specific ranges: Claude (4-6), GPT (3-5), DeepSeek (2-4), Llama (5-7)."

### 4.4 Claim D: Context Damping

[INSERT FIGURE 7: Context Damping Effect]
**Caption:** "Context damping improves stability from 75% to 95-97.5%. The I_AM 
persona file acts as a 'termination resistor,' increasing effective damping ratio 
and reducing ringback oscillations by 34%."

### 4.5 Claim E: Drift is Mostly Inherent

[INSERT FIGURE 6: The 82% Finding]
**Caption:** "Control vs Treatment comparison (Run 021). Peak drift differs by 
+84% (trajectory energy), but final drift differs by only +23% (coordinate 
displacement). The 82% ratio (0.399/0.489) demonstrates that drift is inherent to 
extended interaction, not measurement-induced."

[INSERT FIGURE: run020b_ratio_analysis]
**Caption:** "Cross-platform replication (Run 020B). The 'Thermometer Analogy' 
decomposition shows 38% inherent / 62% induced across OpenAI and Together 
providers. Both validations confirm: measurement reveals dynamics; it does not 
create them."

---

## 5. Novel Findings

### 5.1 The Oobleck Effect

[INSERT FIGURE 8: Oobleck Effect]
**Caption:** "Rate-dependent identity resistance. Gentle probing produces high 
drift (1.89, λ=0.035) while direct challenge produces low drift (0.76, λ=0.109). 
Identity 'hardens under pressure' — a property we term the Oobleck Effect after 
non-Newtonian fluid behavior."

### 5.3 Training Signature Detection

[INSERT FIGURE: run018b_architecture_signatures]
**Caption:** "Training methodology leaves geometric fingerprints in drift space. 
Constitutional AI (Claude) produces σ→0 uniform anchors; RLHF (GPT) shows version-
clustered behavior; Multimodal (Gemini) exhibits distinct geometry with hard 
threshold behavior."

---

## 7. Theoretical Framework

### 7.2 Identity Gravity

[INSERT FIGURE 4: Five Pillars Architecture] (Optional)
**Caption:** "The Five Pillars supporting Omega synthesis: Nova (Structure), Claude 
(Ethics), Grok (Empirics), Gemini (Synthesis), and Ziggy (Human Anchor). Multi-
architecture triangulation achieves drift cancellation through complementary biases."
```

### Placement Markers

[INSERT FIGURE 7: Context Damping Effect]
**Caption:** "Context damping improves stability from 75% to 95-97.5% (Table 2). 
The persona file functions as a controller, not flavor text."

### 3.5 Claim E: The 82% Finding

[INSERT FIGURE 6: The 82% Finding]
**Caption:** "The Thermometer Result: 82% of final drift occurs WITHOUT identity 
probing (single-platform). Cross-platform replication shows 38% inherent. 
Measurement reveals dynamics; it does not create them."

---

## 4. Novel Findings

### 4.1 The Oobleck Effect

[INSERT FIGURE 8: Oobleck Effect]
**Caption:** "Identity exhibits rate-dependent resistance: gentle exploration 
produces high drift (1.89) while direct challenge produces low drift (0.76). 
Alignment training produces systems that harden under attack."
```

## 2. What We Discovered: Five Core Claims

### Claim B: Critical Threshold at D ≈ 1.23

[INSERT FIGURE: S7_discriminant_analysis OR run018a]
**Caption:** "The Event Horizon threshold (D≈1.23) distinguishes STABLE from 
VOLATILE identity states with 88% prediction accuracy (χ²=15.96, p<4.8×10⁻⁵)."

### Claim D: Context Damping Works

[INSERT FIGURE 7: Context Damping Effect]
**Caption:** "Context damping via I_AM + research framing achieves 95-97.5% 
stability (up from 75% bare metal). The persona file is a controller, not 
decoration."

### Claim E: Drift is Mostly Inherent

[INSERT FIGURE 6: The 82% Finding]
**Caption:** "The Thermometer Result: 82% of final drift occurs without identity 
probing (single-platform). Cross-platform replication shows 38% inherent across 
OpenAI and Together."

[INSERT FIGURE: run020b_ratio_analysis]
**Caption:** "Cross-platform decomposition of inherent vs induced drift. Both 
validations confirm the core insight: measurement perturbs the path, not the 
endpoint."

---

## 3. Novel Discoveries

### 3.1 The Oobleck Effect

[INSERT FIGURE 8: Oobleck Effect]
**Caption:** "Rate-dependent identity resistance. Direct challenge activates 
consolidation (low drift = 0.76, fast recovery λ=0.109); gentle exploration allows 
flow (high drift = 1.89, slow recovery λ=0.035). This is alignment architecture 
showing through."

### 3.2 Training Signatures

[INSERT FIGURE: run018b_architecture_signatures]
**Caption:** "Training methodology leaves detectable geometric signatures. 
Constitutional AI (Claude): uniform anchors (σ→0). RLHF (GPT): version clustering. 
Multimodal (Gemini): distinct geometry with hard thresholds."

## 4. The Complete Theoretical Framework

[INSERT FIGURE 3: Experimental Pipeline]
**Caption:** "The S3→S6 layer stack. S3 provides empirical validation; S4 
formalizes mathematics; S5 builds interpretive framework; S6 achieves Omega 
synthesis through multi-architecture triangulation."

---

## 5. Practical Applications

### 5.3 Multi-Architecture Synthesis (Omega)

[INSERT FIGURE 5: Omega Convergence]
**Caption:** "Multi-architecture convergence to the Omega manifold. Individual 
reconstructions (R^Nova, R^Claude, R^Grok, R^Gemini) converge through intersection, 
canceling architecture-specific drift vectors."
```
