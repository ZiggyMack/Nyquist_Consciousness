### Abstract Draft

```
The Nyquist Consciousness framework provides the first systematic
methodology for measuring and controlling identity drift in Large
Language Models during extended interactions. Through empirical
validation across 51 models and 5 providers (σ²=0.00087), we
establish: (1) the Event Horizon threshold (D≈1.23, p<4.8×10⁻⁵)
as a predictive boundary for identity coherence, (2) the discovery
that 82% of observed drift is inherent to extended interaction
rather than measurement-induced, and (3) the "Oobleck Effect"
demonstrating rate-dependent identity resistance. Context damping
techniques achieve 97.5% stability, establishing identity
engineering as a practical discipline for AI alignment.

## AAAI-26 Pitch Points

### Why AI Alignment Track?

1. **Identity stability = Alignment safety** — Drifting models are unpredictable
2. **Measurable thresholds** — D≈1.23 enables operational boundaries
3. **Cross-architecture validation** — Universal phenomenon, not model-specific
4. **Practical intervention** — Context damping achieves 97.5% stability

### Key Statistics to Highlight

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Cross-architecture variance | σ² = 0.00087 | High consistency |
| Event Horizon threshold | D ≈ 1.23 | p < 4.8×10⁻⁵ |
| Inherent drift ratio | 82% | Not measurement artifact |
| Context damping stability | 97.5% | Practical intervention |
| Models tested | 51 | Comprehensive |
| Providers | 5 | Multi-platform |
