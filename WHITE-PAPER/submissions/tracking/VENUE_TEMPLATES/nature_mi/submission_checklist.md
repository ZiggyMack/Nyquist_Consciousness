## Key Points for Nature MI

### Why Nature MI?

1. **High impact** — IF ~25
2. **Interdisciplinary** — Bridges AI, cognitive science, safety
3. **Novelty focus** — First empirical framework
4. **Practical relevance** — Deployment implications

### What Makes This Novel?

1. First quantitative framework for AI identity
2. Cross-architecture validation (51 models)
3. Thermometer finding (82% inherent)
4. Oobleck Effect discovery
5. Practical intervention (97.5% stability)

### Potential Concerns

| Concern | Our Response |
|---------|--------------|
| "Just prompt engineering" | No — fundamental behavioral dynamics |
| "Only one lab" | Multi-provider validation |
| "No human validation" | Future work, but metrics validated |
| "Philosophical speculation" | Empirical, statistical validation |
