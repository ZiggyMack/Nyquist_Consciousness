## Tips for Effective Responses

1. **Be respectful and professional** — Even for harsh reviews
2. **Address every point** — Don't skip comments
3. **Quote the reviewer** — Makes response clear
4. **Be specific about changes** — Page/line numbers
5. **If disagreeing, explain why** — With evidence
6. **Keep a revision log** — Track all changes made
