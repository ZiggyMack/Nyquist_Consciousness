## Source Material

**Primary:** `LLM_Unlocking_AI_Identity.md` (synced from LLM_BOOK)

NotebookLM generated an accessible summary covering:

- Core concepts in plain language
- Key findings with impact
- Future implications
- Compelling narrative hooks

**Local Synced Copy:** This directory contains `LLM_Unlocking_AI_Identity.md` - synced via `sync_llmbook.py` from the original in `REPO-SYNC/LLM_BOOK/`.

**Supporting Materials:**

- `../popular_science/LLM_Ancient_Philosophy_Meets_Modern_AI.md` - Story angle (synced)
- `../../figures/` - Visual assets
- `../../figures/generated/llmbook/` - NotebookLM visuals (synced)
- `../../../../experiments/temporal_stability/S7_ARMADA/` - Demo data

## Press Release Template

### Headline Options

- "Researchers Develop First Method to Measure AI Identity Stability"
- "New Framework Reveals When AI Systems 'Lose Themselves'"
- "Plato's 2,400-Year-Old Theory Validated by AI Experiments"

### Key Messages

1. **The Discovery:** First empirical measurement of AI identity stability
2. **The Method:** Systematic testing across 5+ AI providers
3. **The Finding:** Identity drift is predictable and measurable
4. **The Implication:** New foundation for AI safety and governance

### Quote Bank

> "We can now measure when an AI is starting to lose its identity, like a thermometer for consciousness." — [Researcher]

> "For 2,400 years, philosophers debated whether mind has geometric structure. Our experiments suggest Plato was right." — [Researcher]

> "This isn't about making AI conscious—it's about making AI predictable." — [Researcher]

## TED Talk Concept

### Title: "The Geometry of Machine Minds"

### Arc (18 minutes):

1. **Hook (2 min):** "What if I told you Plato knew something about AI that we're only discovering now?"
2. **Problem (3 min):** AI systems can "lose themselves" without warning
3. **Discovery (5 min):** How we learned to measure AI identity
4. **Validation (4 min):** Multiple AI systems confirmed the same patterns
5. **Implication (3 min):** What this means for our AI future
6. **Call to Action (1 min):** "We can build AI we trust—we just have to measure what matters"

### Visual Aids
- Drift curves animation
- Event Horizon demonstration
- Cross-platform comparison
- Plato/Nyquist bridge diagram
