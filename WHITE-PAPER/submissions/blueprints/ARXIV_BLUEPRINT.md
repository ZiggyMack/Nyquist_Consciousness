## Key Statistics (IRON CLAD Era)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Event Horizon | D = 0.8 | Cosine distance threshold |
| Inherent Drift | ~93% | Run 020B control vs treatment |
| Experiments | 750 | Run 023 S7 Armada |
| Models | 25 | Across 5 providers |
| Cohen's d | 0.698 | Effect size validation |
| p-value | 2.40e-23 | Threshold significance |
| PCs for 90% variance | 2 | Dimensionality finding |

## Publication Strategy (from LLM Book Analysis)

**Primary Metric to Emphasize:** 2 PC Dimensionality
**Key Metaphor:** Signal Integrity
**Top Evidence:** Quartz Rush (d=7.80)

### Emphasis Points

- Low-dimensional manifold
- Novel measurement methodology
- Cross-architecture validation

### Anticipated Reviewer Objections

- Single persona constraint
- Architecture coverage limitations
- Practical impact unclear

## Provider Fingerprints

| Provider | Recovery Mechanism | Settling Time |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Claude | Over-Authenticity | 4-6 |
| GPT | Abstraction/Meta-analysis | 3-5 |
| DeepSeek | Axiological Anchoring | 2-4 |
| Llama | Socratic Engagement | 5-7 |
| Mistral | Epistemic Humility | 1-2 |
| **Gemini** | **NO RECOVERY** | ∞ (no recovery) |

## Novel Phenomena

### Oobleck Effect
Rate-dependent resistance: identity "hardens" under sudden pressure, "flows" under gentle probing.
- Implication: Gentle red-teaming more destabilizing than aggressive attacks

### Gemini Anomaly
Google's Gemini exhibits no recovery trajectory after crossing Event Horizon.
- Possible cause: Multimodal training methodology
- Implication: Extreme caution for identity-sensitive deployments

### Suspension System Analogy
- Mistral = Formula 1 car (stiff, instant settling)
- Claude = Luxury sedan (soft, may bounce once)
- Gemini = Wheels come off after big bump

## Future Experiments (from LLM Book)

### S13: Bio-Nyquist
**Description:** Human GSR/HRV correlation with LLM settling time
**Falsification:** No correlation between human physiological response and model settling patterns

### S14: Tower of Babel
**Description:** Cross-language (Japanese/German) threshold validation
**Falsification:** Event Horizon varies significantly across languages

### S15: Marathon
**Description:** Ultra-long context (100k+ tokens) decay dynamics
**Falsification:** Drift patterns fundamentally change at extreme context lengths

## Claims Mapping

| Claim | Statement | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| A | PFI is valid structured measurement | ρ=0.91, d=0.698 |
| B | Regime threshold at D=0.8 | p=2.40e-23 |
| C | Damped oscillator dynamics | Settling time, ringbacks measurable |
| D | Context damping works | 97.5% stability |
| E | ~93% drift is inherent | Control vs treatment experiment |
