## Requirements Beyond arXiv

### Additional Evidence Required

1. **Human Validation Study (S13: Bio-Nyquist)**
   - External raters scoring PFI
   - Human-AI metric correlation
   - GSR/HRV physiological correlation

2. **Cross-Language Validation (S14: Tower of Babel)**
   - Japanese/German threshold validation
   - Cultural persona variations

3. **Extended Temporal Data (S15: Marathon)**
   - 100k+ token context experiments
   - Long-term drift dynamics

## Anticipated Reviewer Concerns (from LLM Book)

### Concern: Lack of human validation
### Concern: Need for replication studies
### Concern: Generalizability concerns

---

## Strengthening the Claims

### Claim A (PFI Validity) — Already Strong
Current evidence: ρ = 0.91, d = 0.698

**Additional needed:**
- [ ] Human-AI correlation study
- [ ] Test-retest reliability
- [ ] Alternative embedding model validation

### Claim B (Threshold) — Solid
Current evidence: p = 2.40e-23

**Additional needed:**
- [ ] Independent replication
- [ ] Different personas showing same threshold

### Claim E (~93% Inherent) — Core Finding
Current evidence: Run 020B IRON CLAD

**Additional needed:**
- [ ] Multiple control conditions
- [ ] Power analysis
- [ ] Effect size confidence intervals
