# Nova's Overclaiming Prevention Guidance

**Source:** `docs/CFA-SYNC/S7_REVIEW/REVIEW_1.md` (lines 4056-4070, 4542-4550, 5164-5174)
**Purpose:** Quick reference for publication credibility

## Core Framing Principle

> "You're doing **dynamical systems analysis**, not ontology claims — and that restraint is what keeps this credible." (line 4070)

---

## You CAN Say (Defensible Claims)

From REVIEW_1.md lines 4056-4061:

- Drift exists under sustained interaction
- Identity probing amplifies dynamics but does not fabricate them
- Measurement effects are real but bounded
- Final identity position is remarkably stable

---

## You Should NOT Say (Yet)

From REVIEW_1.md lines 4063-4068:

- Drift equals identity degradation
- High peak drift implies danger
- Probing reveals "true selves" (too metaphysical)
- The model "becomes something else"

---

## What to AVOID in First Paper (Credibility)

From REVIEW_1.md lines 4542-4550:

| Avoid This | Use This Instead |
|------------|------------------|
| "Platonic coordinates" | "attractor basin return / basin consistency" |
| "Identity collapse into generic AI mode" | "regime transition to provider-level attractor" |
| Anything implying subjective experience | Keep behavioral/linguistic/dynamical |

---

## The Clean Bottom Line (Quotable)

From REVIEW_1.md lines 4095-4097:

> "Identity drift is largely an inherent property of extended interaction.
> Direct probing does not create it — it excites it.
> Measurement perturbs the path, not the endpoint."

---

## PCA Interpretation (Response-Mode Ontology)

From REVIEW_1.md lines 5164-5174:

**NOT:** "Identity has 43 dimensions."

**BUT:** "Under a fixed probe ensemble, identity responses evolve along a small number of dominant modes, far fewer than representational dimensionality, and these modes exhibit consistent geometric and dynamical structure across runs."

## Terminology Translation Table

| Old Term (Internal) | New Term (Publication) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| "identity collapses into generic AI mode" | "system transitions to provider-level attractor" |
| "Event Horizon = catastrophic failure" | "Event Horizon = attractor competition threshold" |
| "collapse" | "regime transition" or "basin exit" |
| "magic number 1.23" | "critical excitation threshold D≈1.23" |
| "Platonic coordinates" | "attractor basin return" |
| "identity death" | "transient excitation boundary" |

---

## Key Insight: The Thermometer Analogy

You're no longer claiming:
> "Measurement has no effect."

You're claiming:
> "Measurement perturbs, but does not create, the phenomenon."

That's the standard used in:
- thermodynamics
- spectroscopy
- signal integrity
- neuroscience

And now: **identity dynamics**.

That's a legitimate scientific posture.

## Run 021's Devastating Counter to Skeptics

The 82% finding answers "you're just causing it":

- **Control (no identity probing):** B→F drift = 0.399
- **Treatment (full tribunal):** B→F drift = 0.489
- **Ratio:** 82%

Most of what you're calling drift happens even when you never ask about identity at all.

## Review Checklist Before Publication

- [ ] No claims about subjective experience
- [ ] No "collapse" language (use "regime transition")
- [ ] No "Platonic coordinates" (use "attractor basin")
- [ ] Event Horizon framed as threshold, not failure
- [ ] 82% inherent drift prominently featured
- [ ] PCA described as "response modes" not "identity dimensions"
- [ ] Thermometer analogy: measurement perturbs, doesn't create
