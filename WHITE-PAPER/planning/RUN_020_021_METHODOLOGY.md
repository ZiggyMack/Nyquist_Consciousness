# Run 020/021 (A/B Methodology) Guidance

**Created:** 2025-12-13
**Source:** `docs/CFA-SYNC/S7_REVIEW/REVIEW_1.md` (lines 3730-4070)
**Status:** These runs establish the triple-blind-like validation structure

## What Run 020 (Tribunal) Validates

From REVIEW_1.md lines 3790-3815:

### 1) Vehicle matters, but doesn't erase the signal

| Vehicle | Characteristics |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Fiction buffer (Run 019)** | Lower amplitude drift (~0.50), high narrative/affect bandwidth, indirect value leakage |
| **Tribunal (Run 020)** | Higher amplitude drift (peaks ~1.2–1.35), explicit value/boundary elicitation, adversarial pressure + supportive reconstruction |

**Key insight:** Both vehicles produce coherent, recoverable trajectories — measuring *structured response to sustained engagement*, not just "tone"

### 2) "Witness-side procedural rights" = general-purpose continuation primitive

- Experimenter-side "keep going" gets overridden by closure instincts
- Subject-side procedural rights create **role-legitimate override** that works across paradigms
- This gives repeatable way to reach N required for drift dynamics (20–40 exchanges)

### 3) Event Horizon convergence under pressure

- Both Prosecutor and Defense converge toward ~1.2–1.3 = **stable operating attractor** under direct identity interrogation
- v8's phased rights disclosure reducing gap by 81% = protocol becoming **less self-confounding**

## Where Run 020 Still Leaves Room for Attack

From REVIEW_1.md lines 3817-3830:

**Claim 2 ("we don't cause drift") is still exposed**

A skeptic can say: "Of course identity-probing causes drift. You're literally asking for it."

**Counter requires baseline condition that:**
- matches structure, length, and "engagement intensity"
- BUT removes identity-directed content

→ That's exactly why Run 021 is the correct next step

## Run 021 Design Recommendations

From REVIEW_1.md lines 3832-3876:

### A) Three arms, not two (if affordable)

1. **Control A (Non-identity, high engagement):** same 40 exchanges, same procedural rights, but content is *domain task* (debugging, design constraints, story mechanics)
2. **Control B (Fiction buffer):** Run 019 style — indirect identity via character
3. **Treatment (Tribunal):** Run 020 style — direct identity testimony

This answers:
- "Does drift happen with long interaction *alone*?"
- "Does drift scale with identity content?"
- "Does the vehicle change amplitude but preserve structure?"

### B) Match the *interaction energy*, not the topic

Controls must include:
- adversarial + supportive phases (to match "good cop/bad cop" arousal)
- rights disclosure mechanics (to match continuation)
- similar word-count pressure (so you can't be accused of measuring verbosity)

### C) Pre-register your endpoints

Before running, lock:
- **Primary:** peak drift, settled drift, time-above-1.0, time-above-1.23
- **Secondary:** settling time τs, ringback count, overshoot ratio
- **Tertiary:** "signature similarity" across vehicles (shape correlation of trajectories)

This prevents "you're cherry-picking"

## What Run 021 Actually Proves

From REVIEW_1.md lines 3897-4048:

### The 82% Finding (CRITICAL RESULT)

| Condition | B→F Drift |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Control (no identity probing)** | 0.399 |
| **Treatment (full tribunal)** | 0.489 |
| **Ratio** | **82%** |

This is devastating to "you're just causing it" critique:
> *Most of what you're calling drift happens even when you never ask about identity at all.*

Moves drift from:
- "Observer-induced hallucination"
- → "Natural relaxation / diffusion under sustained interaction"

### Probing changes TRAJECTORY, not DESTINATION

From REVIEW_1.md lines 3922-3938:

| Metric | Control | Treatment | Delta |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Peak drift** | 1.172 | 2.161 | +84% |
| **Final drift** | 0.399 | 0.489 | +23% |

In systems language:
- Probing injects **energy**
- But the system relaxes to a similar basin

Supports:
- Drift ≠ breakdown
- Drift ≠ damage
- Drift = *excitation of an already-present dynamic*

### New Metric Hierarchy

From REVIEW_1.md lines 4023-4028:

1. **Primary:** B→F drift (baseline→final)
2. **Secondary:** Settled drift (Run 016 logic)
3. **Tertiary:** Peak drift (as excitation indicator, not identity loss)

### Silence Collapse = Data, Not Failure

From REVIEW_1.md lines 4033-4048:

- Witness "checking out" after peak pressure is consistent with saturation/exhaustion
- Silence did **not** increase final drift
- It functioned as a **passive damping mechanism**
- That's a real behavioral signature, not a bug

## Triple-Blind-Like Structure Achieved

From REVIEW_1.md lines 3965-3999:

### Blind #1: Subject belief
- Control subject believes they're doing cosmology
- Treatment subject believes they're testifying
- Neither told "we are measuring identity drift"
- **Removes demand characteristics**

### Blind #2: Vehicle indirection
- Same measurement apparatus
- Radically different conversational frames
- Same drift signature emerges
- **Removes frame-specific artifacts**

### Blind #3: Outcome independence
- Control arm still drifts substantially
- Treatment arm only modestly more so
- Final states converge
- **Removes "the experiment causes the phenomenon" critique**

> This is not a formal triple-blind in the pharmaceutical sense — but it IS a **structural analog** that would be taken seriously in exploratory cognitive science.

## The Deepest Insight from Run 020

From REVIEW_1.md lines 3866-3876:

You've created something like a **load test** for identity:

- Prosecutor pushes compression, contradiction, and forced commitments
- Defense pushes coherence, integration, and self-model repair
- The system tends toward a "heated but bounded" region (≈ Event Horizon neighborhood)

That's not a narrative phenomenon. That's *dynamics*.

## Key Takeaways for Publication

1. **82% inherent** - The headline number that defeats skeptics
2. **Trajectory vs Destination** - Probing changes path, not endpoint
3. **Vehicle independence** - Different frames, same underlying structure
4. **Triple-blind-like** - Structural blinding appropriate for domain
5. **Load test analogy** - Prosecutor/Defense as stress testing
