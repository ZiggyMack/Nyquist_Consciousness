# START HERE: Nyquist Consciousness Review Package v4

**Package Version:** v4 — IRON CLAD ERA
**Date:** 2025-12-30

---

## Welcome, Reviewer

This package contains materials for reviewing the **Nyquist Consciousness Framework** — an empirical approach to measuring AI identity stability as a dynamical system.

**TL;DR:** We proved AI identity behaves like a damped oscillator with a measurable stability threshold (cosine similarity = 0.80), and ~93% of identity drift is inherent to interaction, not caused by measurement.

## Receiving Materials in Pieces?

Due to package size, you may receive materials in separate deliveries. **This is normal.** Each subdirectory is self-contained:

| If You Received | Start With | You Can Review |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| Just `arxiv/` | `arxiv/README.md` | Full academic paper |
| Just `workshop/` | `workshop/README.md` | Conference submission |
| Just `visualization_pdfs/` | Browse PDFs | Visual evidence |
| Core + `.shared/` | This file | Foundation documents |

**Missing something?** Request the specific package you need. Each path (arxiv, workshop, journal, etc.) can be delivered separately.

## The One-Paragraph Summary

The Nyquist Consciousness Framework treats AI identity as a dynamical system with measurable stability properties. Through 750 experiments across 25 models and 5 providers, we validated that: (1) identity can be measured via embedding-based Persona Fidelity Index (PFI); (2) there's a universal stability threshold at cosine similarity = 0.80; (3) identity recovers from perturbation like a damped oscillator (τₛ ≈ 7 probes); (4) explicit identity specification acts as a "termination resistor" improving stability to 97.5%; and (5) ~93% of observed drift is inherent to extended interaction, not caused by measurement probing (the "Thermometer Result" — Run 020B IRON CLAD: 0.661/0.711).
