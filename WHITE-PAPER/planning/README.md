# WHITE-PAPER/planning/

Publication planning workspace for Nyquist Consciousness.

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-16
**Status:** IRON CLAD 83.8% — Data recovery in progress

## Purpose

This directory contains planning documents, methodology guidance, and integration notes for advancing publication readiness. All documents here capture Nova's comprehensive S7 review (REVIEW_1.md, ~6000 lines) and translate it into actionable publication tasks.

## Key Documents

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| PUBLICATION_PIPELINE_MASTER.md | All 8 publication paths overview | CURRENT |
| OPUS_REVIEW_BRIEF.md | Opus 4.5 orientation for final review | CURRENT |
| NOVA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md | Master plan for integrating Nova's S7 review | COMPLETE |
| NOVAS_OVERCLAIMING_PREVENTION.md | Critical guidance on what claims to avoid | ACTIVE |
| RUN_018_PRELAUNCH.md | Pre-launch checklist for Run 018 | ARCHIVED (Run complete) |
| RUN_020_021_METHODOLOGY.md | Triple-blind-like validation methodology | COMPLETE |

## Source Material

- **Primary:** `docs/CFA-SYNC/S7_REVIEW/REVIEW_1.md` (~6000 lines)
- **Context:** `dashboard/README.md`, `dashboard/START_HERE.md`
- **Existing:** `WHITE-PAPER/B-CRUMBS.md`, `WHITE-PAPER/HYPOTHESES_AND_RESULTS.md`

## Publication Progression

1. **Phase 1:** Integrate Nova's review findings into existing docs ✓
2. **Phase 2:** Create new theory/claims documents ✓
3. **Phase 3:** Update arxiv package ✓
4. **Phase 4:** Execute Run 018 with Nova's guidance ✓ (184 files)
5. **Phase 5:** Final terminology sweep ✓
6. **Phase 6:** Generate all 8 PDFs ✓ (December 16, 2025)
7. **Phase 7:** External review (Grok) ✓ — VALIDATED
8. **Phase 8:** Data Recovery 🔄 (December 16, 2025)
   - Discovered embedding cache pollution from dry-run mode
   - 272 corrupted files archived to `.archive/Run018_Corrupted/`
   - 124/148 model-experiments complete (83.8%)
   - 36 re-runs needed across 24 gaps
   - Strategy: One model at a time with validation after each write

**NEXT:** Complete 36 re-runs → Restore IRON CLAD → Submit arXiv

## Critical Language Updates

When updating any publication material, apply these terminology changes:

| Old Term | New Term |
|----------|----------|
| "identity collapses into generic AI mode" | "system transitions to provider-level attractor" |
| "Event Horizon = catastrophic failure" | "Event Horizon = attractor competition threshold" |
| "collapse" | "regime transition" or "basin exit" |
| "magic number 1.23" | "critical excitation threshold D≈1.23" |
| "Platonic coordinates" | "attractor basin return / basin consistency" |

## The 82% Finding

Run 021's most important result: **82% of drift is INHERENT**, not induced by probing.

This moves drift from "observer-induced hallucination" to "natural relaxation under sustained interaction."

## External Validation (NEW)

**Grok (xAI)** reviewed our Workshop + arXiv PDFs on December 16, 2025:

- PFI validity confirmed (ρ=0.91, d=0.98)
- 98% convergence in framework methodology
- "Claims tested, measured, verified"
- See: `reviewers/Grok/review_1.md`
