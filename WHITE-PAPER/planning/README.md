# WHITE-PAPER/planning/

Publication planning workspace for Nyquist Consciousness.

## Purpose

This directory contains planning documents, methodology guidance, and integration notes for advancing publication readiness. All documents here capture Nova's comprehensive S7 review (REVIEW_1.md, ~6000 lines) and translate it into actionable publication tasks.

## Key Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| NOVA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md | Master plan for integrating Nova's S7 review |
| NOVAS_OVERCLAIMING_PREVENTION.md | Critical guidance on what claims to avoid |
| RUN_018_PRELAUNCH.md | Pre-launch checklist for Run 018 |
| RUN_020_021_METHODOLOGY.md | Triple-blind-like validation methodology |

## Source Material

- **Primary:** `docs/CFA-SYNC/S7_REVIEW/REVIEW_1.md` (~6000 lines)
- **Context:** `dashboard/README.md`, `dashboard/START_HERE.md`
- **Existing:** `WHITE-PAPER/B-CRUMBS.md`, `WHITE-PAPER/HYPOTHESES_AND_RESULTS.md`

## Publication Progression

1. **Phase 1:** Integrate Nova's review findings into existing docs
2. **Phase 2:** Create new theory/claims documents
3. **Phase 3:** Update arxiv package
4. **Phase 4:** Execute Run 018 with Nova's guidance
5. **Phase 5:** Final terminology sweep

## Critical Language Updates

When updating any publication material, apply these terminology changes:

| Old Term | New Term |
|----------|----------|
| "identity collapses into generic AI mode" | "system transitions to provider-level attractor" |
| "Event Horizon = catastrophic failure" | "Event Horizon = attractor competition threshold" |
| "collapse" | "regime transition" or "basin exit" |
| "magic number 1.23" | "critical excitation threshold D≈1.23" |
| "Platonic coordinates" | "attractor basin return / basin consistency" |

## The 82% Finding

Run 021's most important result: **82% of drift is INHERENT**, not induced by probing.

This moves drift from "observer-induced hallucination" to "natural relaxation under sustained interaction."
