# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch. Consumers should track `main`
or a tagged release derived from it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a vulnerability in the LOGOS constructive LEM
verification pipeline or the sandboxed agent boot sequence, please follow these
steps:

1. **Do not** create a public issue with exploit details.
2. Email the maintainers at `security@projectlogos.ai` with a summary of the
   issue, the steps required to reproduce it, and the potential impact.
3. Encrypt sensitive reports using the Project LOGOS PGP key if available.
4. You will receive an acknowledgement within five business days.

## Responsible Disclosure

- We will coordinate with you to validate the issue and develop a fix.
- Once a remediation is ready, we will publish an advisory describing the
  vulnerability, its impact, and mitigation steps.
- Please allow us up to 90 days to address the issue before going public unless
  a shorter timeline is mutually agreed upon.

Thank you for helping us keep the LOGOS agent verification pipeline secure.
