Recursion cycle delta:
- Consolidated SCP findings (artifacts 1763172532_0, 1763172474_0) into sandbox/plan.md.
- Captured three concrete success criteria (git access restored, scp_nexus dry-run vetted, repo py_compile clean).
- Logged measurable experiment: run python -m py_compile over Synthetic_Cognition_Protocol, owned by Operator, deadline 2025-11-16T17:00:00Z with artifacted output.
- Executed experiment: wrote sandbox/artifact_1763173196_pycompile.json (92 files, 0 errors) and marked status=pass.
- Rewrote plan.md as structured roadmap (context, success criteria, primary_experiment, secondary_tasks, risks).
- Drafted sandbox/scp_nexus_dry_run.py and executed guarded import; run produced artifact_1763174127_scp_nexus_dry_run.json recording ModuleNotFoundError for Logos_Agent.agent.
- Plan/reflect updated to highlight missing module unblocker before retrying nexus experiment.
