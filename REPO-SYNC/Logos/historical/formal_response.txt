Let D be the domain of discourse and let P: D -> {True, False} be the target predicate. A condition C: D -> {True, False} is necessary and sufficient for P iff both clauses hold: 1) Necessity: for all x in D, P(x) implies C(x). 2) Sufficiency: for all x in D, C(x) implies P(x). Equivalently, for all x in D, C(x) is logically equivalent to P(x). Both predicates must be defined on the same domain and internally consistent, otherwise the biconditional fails.
