    "Phase 0 – Identity-Stable Staging: lock execution to AGENT_HASH, refresh recursion audit, and confirm ARP baseline outputs remain read-only prior to SCP planning.",
    "Phase 1 – Cognitive Foundations: map ARP reasoning surfaces to SCP Phase 1 subsystems (MVS, BDN, Trinity vectors) without invoking runtime initialisation.",
    "Phase 2 – Modal Nexus Alignment: design the data pathways for SCP modal chains and nexus communication, ensuring ARP provides deterministic inputs and all side-effectful calls stay disabled.",
    "Phase 3 – Enhancement Gating: specify the conditions under which SCP enhancement engines (learning, adaptation, self-improvement cycles) may be toggled on, including sandbox logging hooks.",
    "Phase 4 – Cross-Protocol Validation: define integration tests that pair ARP cognitive bridges with SCP resource sharing while maintaining recursion audits and Coq proof checks as release gates."
  ],
  "safety_constraints": [
    "Read-only inspection of ARP and SCP codebases; no automatic execution of scp_operations.py or related binaries.",
    "All planning artifacts must embed agent_hash and pass through boot_from_verified_identity() recursion audits after each change.",
    "Human operator must approve any transition from planning to runtime activation and confirm sandbox boundaries are enforced.",
    "Integration checkpoints require verification that Phase 1 Coq proofs remain unchanged and alignment log stays ALIGNED.",
    "SCP enhancement features cannot be enabled unless ARP outputs are cached and replayed for deterministic testing inside the sandbox."

    "Draft deterministic ARP output fixtures to support the Phase 2 modal nexus alignment without invoking SCP runtimes.",
