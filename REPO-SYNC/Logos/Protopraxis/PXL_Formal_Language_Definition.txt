PXL_FORMAL_LANGUAGE_DEFINITION

---

1. TOKEN SET

• Constants: a, b, c, ..., z
• Variables: x, y, z
• Modal Operators: □ (necessity), ◇ (possibility)
• PXL Operators:
   - ⧟ : Identity (self-coherence)
   - ⇎ : Non-equivalence
   - ⇌ : Interchange (balance)
   - ⟹ : Implication
   - ∼ : Negation
   - ≀ : Conflation
   - ⫴ : Dichotomy
   - ⟼ : Grounded entailment
   - ⩪ : Modal coherence equivalence

2. GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE

• Atomic formula: Px, Qxy, R(x)
• Well-Formed Formula (WFF) Rules:
   - If φ is WFF, then □φ and ◇φ are WFF
   - If φ and ψ are WFF, then φ ⟹ ψ, φ ⇌ ψ, and φ ⩪ ψ are WFF
   - If φ is WFF, then ∼φ is WFF
   - If x is variable and φ is WFF, then ∀x φ and ∃x φ are WFF

3. INFERENCE RULES

• Modus Groundens (custom): If □(x ⧟ y) and x ⟼ P, then y ⟼ P
• Triune Dependency Substitution: If φ grounded in 𝕀₁, ∃ψ grounded in 𝕀₂, then φ ⇌ ψ → coherence(𝕆)
• Privative Collapse: If ∼◇(𝕆 ⟼ P), then P is incoherent

4. SEMANTIC DOMAIN

• Domain: D = {𝕆, 𝕀₁, 𝕀₂, 𝕀₃, W₁...Wn}
• Accessibility Relation: S5 modal frame (reflexive, symmetric, transitive)
• Valuation: ⟦φ⟧ᵂ = true iff φ holds in all accessible worlds from W
