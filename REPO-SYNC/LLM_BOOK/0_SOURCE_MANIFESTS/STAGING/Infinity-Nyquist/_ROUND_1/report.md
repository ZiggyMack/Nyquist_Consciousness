## Infographic Requests

### Infographic 1: The Six Stones of Nyquist

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Level of detail:** Detailed (BETA)
- **Orientation:** Landscape

**Description for NotebookLM:**
> Create a horizontal diagram showing six stones in a row, each with its Nyquist mapping. From left to right: MIND (Pre-flight + Clean Separation, cheat score < 0.65), POWER (Statistical Scale, N=51, 5 providers), REALITY (PFI Metric, ρ=0.91, d=0.98), SOUL (82% Inherent Finding, Thermometer Result), SPACE (Cross-Architecture, 5 training paradigms), TIME (Event Horizon D=1.23, τₛ=6.1). Use colored circles for each stone (yellow, purple, red, orange, blue, green). Below each stone, show its "Without It..." failure mode. Center banner: "THE SIX STONES OF NYQUIST — All Required, None Redundant." Bottom note: "Context Damping (97.5%) = The Snap — only possible with full gauntlet."

---

### Infographic 2: The Gauntlet Architecture

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Level of detail:** Standard
- **Orientation:** Portrait

## Audio Guide Requests

### Audio 1: The Infinity Framework Deep Dive

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Deep Dive (lively conversation unpacking and connecting topics)
- **Length:** Long

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Explore the Infinity Framework as a meta-organizational pattern for research completeness. Cover the six stones and their Nyquist mappings in depth. Discuss why the mapping works — both systems solve the same problem of achieving complex outcomes through coordinated subsystems. Examine the synergy principle and why removing any stone collapses the system. Connect to the broader insight that good methodology converges on this architecture. End with practical applications: how to use this for research validation, education, and publication.

---

### Audio 2: Can You Audit Your Own Research?

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Deep Dive (lively conversation)
- **Length:** Default

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Focus on the practical application of the Completeness Audit. Walk through how to score a research project on the 0-12 scale. Discuss what each stone checklist asks for and why. Cover common failure modes — which stones are typically weakest and why. Explain how to use audit gaps to prioritize improvements. Include the interpretation guide for what different score ranges mean. End with the meta-question: can the Infinity Framework audit itself?

---

### Audio 3: Precision vs Brute Force — The Design Philosophy

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Debate (thoughtful debate illuminating different perspectives)
- **Length:** Default

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Debate whether the six-stone architecture is genuinely universal or just one valid approach. One perspective: Complex precision outcomes always require these six functions — this is fundamental, not arbitrary. Other perspective: Different systems might need different numbers of components; forcing six is Procrustean. Explore: Is there a formal proof that six is necessary? Could some stones be combined? Are there systems that work with fewer? What about systems that need more? Conclude with the practical position: even if not universal, it's a useful heuristic.

---

### Audio 4: The LLM Book Discovery

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Brief (bite-sized overview of core ideas)
- **Length:** Short

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Quick overview of the key discovery: the LLM Book Chew System already implements the Infinity Framework without having been designed that way. Cover the mapping: 0_chew.py = Mind, Registry = Space, Round system = Soul, NotebookLM = Reality, Projects = Power, BURP = Time. Explain why this matters — good methodology converges on this architecture. This validates the framework through emergent confirmation rather than post-hoc rationalization.

---

## Video Overview Requests

### Video 1: Introduction to the Infinity Framework

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive, connects the dots)
- **Visual Style:** Whiteboard (clean diagrams, educational feel)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Create an explainer video introducing the Infinity Framework. Start with the core insight: complex precision systems require six coordinated components, not brute force. Map each Infinity Stone to its research function: Mind (methodology), Power (scale), Reality (measurement), Soul (validity), Space (generalization), Time (temporal dynamics). Show the synergy principle — how removing any stone collapses the system. End with practical application: the Completeness Audit as a research validation tool. Use clean diagrams showing the Gauntlet architecture.

---

### Video 2: The Completeness Audit

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Classic (clean, professional)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Walk through the Completeness Audit as a practical tool. Show the six-section checklist structure. For each stone, visualize: what to verify, how to score (0/1/2), what failure looks like. Show the scoring interpretation guide (12/12 = Complete Gauntlet, etc.). Demonstrate how to use gaps to prioritize research improvements. End with the key insight: this isn't about perfection, it's about knowing where your methodology is strong and where it needs work.

---

### Video 3: The Synergy Principle

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Heritage (serious, historical gravitas)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Explain why all six stones are required for the system to work. The Snap wouldn't succeed with five stones — each plays a non-redundant role. Walk through failure modes: Mind missing = artifacts, Power missing = anecdotes, Reality missing = no numbers, Soul missing = no validity, Space missing = local only, Time missing = no thresholds. Show emergent capabilities that only exist with full gauntlet: Oobleck Effect, Training Signatures, Context Damping. The conclusion: synergy creates capabilities no component achieves alone.

---

### Video 4: Pop Culture Meets Rigor

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Brief (bite-sized, core ideas quickly)
- **Visual Style:** Anime (stylized, philosophical)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Quick exploration of why the pop culture framing works. The Infinity Stones mapping isn't arbitrary — both systems solve the same architectural problem. "Six components, all required, none redundant" communicates instantly. Address the skeptic: there's a formal-only version for those who reject Marvel associations. The deeper point: metaphors have always served science (Schrödinger's Cat, rubber-sheet spacetime). The test is whether the mapping illuminates or obscures — and this one illuminates.

---

### Video 5: The LLM Book Discovery

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Whiteboard (technical diagrams)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Reveal the meta-discovery: the LLM Book Chew System already implements the Infinity Framework. Show the mapping: 0_chew.py prevents contamination (Mind), Registry enables cross-pollination (Space), Round system validates through iteration (Soul), NotebookLM provides concrete analysis (Reality), Project accumulation builds statistical base (Power), BURP timing determines when to act (Time). The key insight: this wasn't designed — good methodology converges on this architecture naturally. This emergent confirmation validates the framework's universality.
