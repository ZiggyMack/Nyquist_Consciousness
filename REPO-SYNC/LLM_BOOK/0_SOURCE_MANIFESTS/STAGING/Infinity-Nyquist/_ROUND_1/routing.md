# Routing: Infinity-Nyquist Framework

**Project:** Infinity-Nyquist
**Round:** 1
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** SPECIAL - Meta-Framework (Not for CHEWED/)

---

## IMPORTANT: This Project is Different

Infinity-Nyquist is NOT a standard research project. It is:
- A **meta-framework** that describes the system it lives in
- An **audit tool** for all other projects
- A **living document** that evolves as the framework matures
- The **test case** for `--promote chew` functionality

**DO NOT move to CHEWED/** - This stays in STAGING as source archive.

## Promotion Complete (2026-02-04)

### Artifacts Created

| Destination | File | Purpose |
|-------------|------|---------|
| Consciousness/RIGHT/synthesis/ | INFINITY_FRAMEWORK.md | Deep synthesis treatment |
| docs/maps/ | 18_INFINITY_COMPLETENESS_AUDIT.md | Practical checklist tool |

### Source Archive

This folder (STAGING/Infinity-Nyquist/) remains as:
- Source material archive (_IN/)
- Analysis development (_ROUND_1/)
- Cross-pollination hub (registry questions Q83-Q88)

---

## Future Development

### When to Create _ROUND_2

- After EXP-INF-1 (stone inventory) completes
- When cross-pollination questions are answered
- If framework needs revision based on usage

### --promote chew Template
