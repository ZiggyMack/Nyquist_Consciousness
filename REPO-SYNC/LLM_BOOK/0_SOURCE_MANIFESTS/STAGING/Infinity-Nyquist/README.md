This video transcript examines why **Thanos required the complete set of Infinity Stones** to successfully execute his universal plan. Each gem serves a **specialized mechanical purpose**, such as the **Space Stone** extending the reach of the effect across the cosmos while the **Power Stone** acts as the necessary energy source. The **Reality and Soul Stones** work in tandem to physically transform matter into dust and house the spirits of the victims within a separate realm. Furthermore, the **Time Stone** ensures the event occurs simultaneously everywhere, and the **Mind Stone** functions as a conductor to translate the user’s will into a singular command. Ultimately, the source argues that the **Infinity Gauntlet** is an interconnected system where no individual artifact possesses the capability to alter the universe on such a massive scale alone.
