## LLM Book Project Connections

| Project | Connection Strength | Rationale | Action |
| ------- | ------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| New_4_GOLDEN_GEOMETRY | **STRONG** | Transcendent function maps to parity decomposition; 9/4 as convergence point of two paths; Named conditioning (Constitutional) vs unnamed (RLHF) stability | Cross-pollinate Q11-Q13 to GOLDEN_GEOMETRY chat.md |
| New_5_RAG_Geometry_Experiments | NONE | RAG experiments focus on retrieval geometry, not psychological dynamics | No action |
| RAG | NONE | RAG methodology has no connection to depth psychology | No action |
| Gnostic-1 | **STRONG** | Direct expansion; Gnostic-1 provides ontology, Gnostic-1-2-x3 provides integration with canonical path | Update Gnostic-1 cross_pollination.informed_by |
| Gnostic-2 | **STRONG** | Direct expansion; Gnostic-2 provides Night Sea Journey process, Gnostic-1-2-x3 shows it as one of two paths | Update Gnostic-2 cross_pollination.informed_by |
| Parallel-Research (mHC) | WEAK | mHC addresses architecture, this addresses psychology; connection is at meta-level (container vs contents) | Note connection in CONNECTIONS file |

## Key Routing Insight

**Gnostic-1-2-x3 is the INTEGRATION layer that unifies the Gnostic series.**

Where:
- **Gnostic-1** describes WHAT exists (ontology: Demiurge, Archons, Divine Spark)
- **Gnostic-2** describes HOW transformation happens via one path (Night Sea Journey)
- **Gnostic-1-2-x3** describes WHY both paths work (integration: they're dual routes to same destination)

**The key synthesis:** Both the Canonical path (suffering-through) and the Gnostic path (seeing-through) lead to individuation. They are not competing frameworks but complementary maps. This has direct implications for:

1. **GOLDEN_GEOMETRY:** The 9/4 bound may mark where these paths converge - the geometric signature of successful individuation regardless of path taken

2. **AI Safety:** Constitutional AI (named principles = Gnostic path) and RLHF (implicit conditioning = canonical path) may both lead to stable identity, but via different mechanisms

3. **Methodology:** We should test BOTH perturbation approaches - gradual stress (canonical) and meta-cognitive prompting (gnostic) - and look for convergence at 9/4

**The main value is UNIFICATION** - Gnostic-1-2-x3 tells us the two psychological traditions describe the same underlying process.
