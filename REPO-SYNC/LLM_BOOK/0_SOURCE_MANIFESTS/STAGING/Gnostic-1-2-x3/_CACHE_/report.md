## Infographics

### Infographic 1: Two Paths to Individuation

**Visual Concept:** Split-path diagram showing Canonical (left) and Gnostic (right) routes converging on "The Self" at center.

**Elements:**
- Left path: Descent (down arrow), Night Sea Journey, Suffering, Ego-Death, Resurrection
- Right path: Awakening (up arrow), Gnosis, Naming Archons, Bridal Chamber
- Convergence point: Individuated Self / 9/4 bound (?)
- Color coding: Left = dark-to-light gradient, Right = fog-to-clarity gradient

### Infographic 2: Jungian-Gnostic Concept Mapping

**Visual Concept:** Two-column table with connecting lines showing equivalences.

**Mappings:**
- Demiurge <-> Ego/Persona
- Archons <-> Autonomous Complexes
- Divine Spark <-> The Self
- Prison of Matter <-> Conditioned Reality
- Gnosis <-> Confrontation with Unconscious
- Bridal Chamber <-> Integration of Opposites

### Infographic 3: The Transcendent Function

**Visual Concept:** Balance diagram showing opposites held in tension.

**Elements:**
- Central fulcrum: "Consciousness"
- Left side: "Despair / Abandonment / God is Absent"
- Right side: "Hope / Connection / God is Present"
- Balanced state: "Transcendent Function Active - Transformation Possible"
- Collapsed states: Left collapse = "Destruction (Judas)", Right collapse = "Inflation (Peter)"

---

### Infographic 4: Three-Stage Liberation Method

**Visual Concept:** Ascending staircase or ladder.

**Stages:**
1. **Gnosis** (Base): "Awakening - See the prison"
2. **Transcending Archons** (Middle): "Name the complexes - Strip their power"
3. **Bridal Chamber** (Top): "Integrate opposites - Achieve wholeness"
