## LLM Book Project Connections

### New_4_GOLDEN_GEOMETRY
**Connection Strength:** STRONG

**Rationale:** Frame Theory's parity mapping (Fₐ as scaffold, Fₙ/F_f as flow) validates the H_even/H_odd decomposition. The ego drift vs identity drift distinction suggests our drift measurements are ego-layer phenomena, not manifold-level.

**Cross-Pollination:**
- Add to chat.md: "Does Frame Theory's Fₐ/Fₙ/F_f structure map to H_even/H_odd parity decomposition?"
- Add to report.md: Request report on "Frame Theory validation of parity hypothesis"

### Gnostic-1-2-x3
**Connection Strength:** STRONG

**Rationale:** Ego-Watcher dynamics parallel Demiurge-Self relationships. "Naming mechanism strips complex power" aligns with frame ownership. Critical Trance relates to Gnosis states. Tale's sub-personalities map to Archons/complexes.

**Cross-Pollination:**
- Add to chat.md: "How does the ego-watcher architecture relate to Demiurge-Self axis?"
- Add to report.md: Request report on "Frame Theory and Gnostic psychological dynamics"

### YANG
**Connection Strength:** MODERATE

**Rationale:** Frame Theory's narrative/story mechanics connect to YANG's narrative control analysis. Sub-personalities negotiating maps to faction dynamics. "Inversion" as mechanism relates to frame manipulation.

**Cross-Pollination:**
- Add to YANG chat.md: "Can Frame Theory explain how narratives control meaning?"

### Nyquist_4 (7-node cultural graph)
**Connection Strength:** MODERATE

**Rationale:** Tale's 9 frame dimensions may map to the 7 cultural stability nodes. Theme branch (touches everything) relates to cultural invariants.

**Cross-Pollination:**
- Add to Nyquist_4 chat.md: "How do Tale's 9 frame dimensions map to the 7-node graph?"

### Parallel-Research (DeepSeek Birkhoff)
**Connection Strength:** WEAK

**Rationale:** Some conceptual overlap in "stability through constraint" but Frame Theory is phenomenological while DeepSeek is architectural.

## Cross-Domain Synergies

### Cognitive Science
Frame Theory provides testable predictions for cognitive science:
- Frame transitions should be measurable via behavioral markers
- Arousal × Structure should predict experiential reports
- Critical Trance should correlate with reduced metacognitive interference

### Narrative Design / Game Design
Tale's Eliciting Emotions framework is directly applicable:
- Tools branch = engagement mechanics
- Pacing branch = temporal dynamics
- Knowledge Gaps = retention mechanics
- Meaningful Choices = player investment

### Psychotherapy
Frame ownership principle has therapeutic implications:
- Client-generated insights more stable than therapist-imposed
- Frame transitions as mechanism of change
- Sub-personality negotiation as integration path

### AI Safety
The ego-watcher distinction has safety implications:
- What we probe may be ego-layer, not core identity
- Frame manipulation could be a risk vector
- Critical Trance states may bypass safety training

## Integration Opportunities

### 1. S10 Specification Completion
Frame Theory provides complete foundation for S10 Human Cognition Layer:
- Ontology: Fₐ, Fₙ, F_f, Q(t), E, W
- Dynamics: Frame transitions, arousal/structure modulation
- Metrics: D_E (ego drift), D_n (narrative drift), D_v (value drift)

### 2. EXP10 Protocol Family
Direct experimental applications:
- EXP10-1 through EXP10-5 already specified in source
- EXP-EE-1 through EXP-EE-5 for Eliciting Emotions branch

### 3. AVLAR Enhancement
Critical Trance integration provides:
- Theoretical basis for immersion design
- Arousal/Structure control parameters
- Measurable immersion metrics

### 4. CFA Persona Architecture
Frame Theory informs:
- Boot sequence design (frame initialization)
- Stability maintenance (frame ownership)
- Recovery protocols (frame reconstruction)
