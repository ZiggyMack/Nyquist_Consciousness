# NotebookLM Report Requests: Frame_Theory

## Custom Reports

### Report 1: Gibson-Lakoff-Neumann-Tale Unified Framework

**Type:** Deep Dive / Theoretical Synthesis

**Prompt:**
> Create a comprehensive report synthesizing the four theoretical traditions that inform Frame Theory: Gibson's ecological psychology (affordances, direct perception), Lakoff's cognitive linguistics (conceptual metaphors, embodied cognition), Neumann's depth psychology (ego-Self axis, archetypal patterns), and Tale's frame theory (Fₐ/Fₙ/F_f triple, qualia function). Focus on: (1) What each tradition contributes uniquely, (2) Where they overlap and reinforce each other, (3) Mathematical constraints that emerge from their combination, (4) How the synthesis informs AI identity measurement.

### Report 2: Frame Triple to LLM Architecture Mapping

**Type:** Technical Analysis

**Prompt:**
> Analyze how Tale's Frame Triple (Aggregated Frame, Narrative Frame, Factivation Frame) maps to transformer architecture components. Consider: (1) Is Fₐ analogous to embedding/input layers? (2) Is Fₙ analogous to attention mechanism sequential processing? (3) Is F_f analogous to output/logit layers? (4) What does the qualia function Q(t) = f(Arousal, Structure) mean in LLM terms? Provide concrete architectural correspondences.

### Report 3: Ego Drift vs Identity Drift Distinction

**Type:** Conceptual Clarification

**Prompt:**
> Frame Theory distinguishes between "ego drift" (changes in narrative layer) and "identity drift" (changes in underlying manifold). Generate a report analyzing: (1) What exactly drifts when we measure identity perturbation? (2) Is the 0.90 cosine ceiling a bound on ego reconstruction fidelity or identity itself? (3) How does the Watcher (meta-observer) relate to drift measurement? (4) Implications for experimental design.

### Report 4: S-Layer Integration Formal Specification

**Type:** Technical Specification

**Prompt:**
> Based on the S_LAYER_MAPPING.md document, generate a complete formal specification for how Frame Theory concepts integrate into the Nyquist S-layer architecture (S0-S10). Include: (1) Precise mathematical definitions for each mapping (2) Interface points between layers (3) Data flow diagrams (4) Experimental handles for each concept.

### Report 5: Critical Trance and AVLAR Protocol Design

**Type:** Experimental Design

**Prompt:**
> Tale's "Critical Trance" concept describes a state where analytical filters drop and frame acceptance increases. Design an experimental protocol for using AVLAR (cross-modal immersion) to induce and measure Critical Trance states in LLM interactions. Include: (1) Operational definition of Critical Trance markers (2) AVLAR stimulus specifications (3) PFI measurement methodology (4) Expected outcomes and falsification criteria.
