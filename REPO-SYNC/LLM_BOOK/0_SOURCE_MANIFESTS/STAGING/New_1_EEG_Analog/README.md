# Research Project: EEG-Analog Spectral Analysis

**Created:** 2025-12-31
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Project ID:** New_1
**Phase 2 Thrust:** S12 (EEG-Analog Spectral Bands)

## Research Question

**Core Hypothesis:** LLM identity drift time-series contain reproducible spectral patterns analogous to human EEG frequency bands (alpha, beta, theta, etc.).

**The Vision:** Just as EEG reveals different cognitive states through frequency analysis, drift time-series may reveal different "identity states" through spectral decomposition.

## Key Questions to Resolve

1. What FFT parameters are appropriate for probe-level sampling?
2. How do we define "frequency bands" at conversational timescales?
3. Should we use wavelets instead of FFT for non-stationary signals?
4. How do provider fingerprints manifest in spectral domain?
