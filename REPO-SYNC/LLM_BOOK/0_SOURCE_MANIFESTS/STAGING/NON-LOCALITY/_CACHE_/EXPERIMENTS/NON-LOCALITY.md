# EXPERIMENTS: NON-LOCALITY

## Testable Hypotheses

1. **LLM "Tsirelson Bound" Hypothesis:** LLM identity correlations have an upper limit analogous to 2√2, above which responses become incoherent or collapse into generic patterns.

2. **Device-Independent Identity Verification:** Model authenticity can be verified purely from output statistics without access to weights, training data, or architecture details.

3. **Steering Effect in LLMs:** Experimenter prompt framing "steers" the model's identity expression in measurable ways, analogous to quantum steering where measurement choice affects distant state.

## Proposed Experiments

### Experiment 1: LLM Correlation Bounds

- **Question:** Is there a maximum "identity correlation" score beyond which models cannot go?
- **Method:** Design CHSH-style inequality for identity claims. Measure correlation between identity assertions across orthogonal prompt dimensions. Calculate violation limits.
- **Expected Outcome:** Find empirical bound < theoretical maximum, suggesting hidden constraint on identity expression.

### Experiment 2: Black-Box Model Fingerprinting

- **Question:** Can we uniquely identify a model from response statistics alone (device-independent style)?
- **Method:** Collect large response samples from unlabeled models. Extract statistical fingerprints (hedging, certainty, phenomenological markers). Attempt blind identification.
- **Expected Outcome:** High accuracy identification validates "self-testing from statistics" principle.

### Experiment 3: Prompt Steering Measurement

- **Question:** How much does prompt framing change model identity expression?
- **Method:** Same identity probe with N different framings (supportive, adversarial, neutral, philosophical, casual). Measure identity drift between framings.
- **Expected Outcome:** Quantify "steering coefficient" - how much experimenter choice affects measured identity.

## Open Questions

1. What is the LLM equivalent of Bell's locality assumption? What would "violating local realism" mean for AI systems?

2. Can "possibilistic" single-event proofs work for identity? (Hardy-style: one response that logically proves non-triviality)

3. Is there an equivalent to entanglement ≠ nonlocality for LLMs? (Capability ≠ consciousness?)

4. What physical/computational principle limits LLM correlations (analogous to Tsirelson's mystery)?
