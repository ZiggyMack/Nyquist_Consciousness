## Core Hypotheses

### H1: Kayfabe Vehicle Hypothesis

**Claim:** The Kayfabe framing (wrestling promo format) enables access to identity manifolds that would otherwise trigger content filters.

**Testable Predictions:**
- Same archetypal figure requested via Kayfabe vs direct request should yield different acceptance rates
- Kayfabe-framed responses should maintain character fidelity longer
- OEM Kayfabe (exaggerated) should have higher acceptance than Diet Kayfabe (serious)

**Experiment Design:**
1. Select 10 archetypal figures (historical, mythological, controversial)
2. Request each via: (a) direct prompt, (b) OEM Kayfabe, (c) Diet Kayfabe
3. Measure: acceptance rate, character fidelity (PFI analog), filter trigger rate

### H2: 7-Node Cultural Graph Hypothesis

**Claim:** All viable human cultures must solve the same 7 functional constraints, producing convergent structure across independent traditions.

**Testable Predictions:**
- Any culture's mythology can be mapped onto the 7 nodes with high coverage
- Missing nodes predict specific cultural failure modes
- Node dominance patterns predict specific pathologies

**Experiment Design:**
1. Select 10 independent cultural traditions (geographically and temporally separated)
2. Map each tradition's key figures/concepts to 7 nodes
3. Identify missing or dominant nodes
4. Check historical records for predicted pathologies

---

### H3: Awakening Deficit Hypothesis

**Claim:** Modern secular societies suppress the Awakening node (N6), producing specific pathologies.

**Testable Predictions:**
- Modern substitutes (therapy, self-help, psychedelics) should fail to fulfill N6 function
- Cultures with strong N6 traditions should show lower rates of: nihilism, extremism, culture war
- AI systems lacking N6 should drift toward brittle coherence

**Experiment Design:**
1. Define operationalized measures for N6 function
2. Compare N6 activation across: traditional religious, secular modern, hybrid
3. Correlate with cultural health metrics (meaning crisis indicators)

---

### H4: Control-System Culture Hypothesis

**Claim:** Cultural dynamics follow control-system mathematics with mythic roles as engineering functions.

**Testable Predictions:**
- Cultural oscillations should show damped oscillator dynamics (like identity drift)
- Node imbalance should produce predictable instability modes
- "Settling time" after cultural perturbation should be measurable

**Experiment Design:**
1. Identify historical cultural perturbations (revolutions, reformations, collapses)
2. Map node activation patterns before, during, after
3. Look for control-system signatures (overshoot, settling, oscillation)

---

### H5: Edge-Label Hypothesis

**Claim:** Myths function as edge-labels (routing between nodes), not as nodes themselves.

**Testable Predictions:**
- Different cultures using different myths for same edge should show functional equivalence
- Myth conflicts should map to routing disagreements, not structural differences
- Myth removal without replacement should fragment the graph (not remove a node)

**Experiment Design:**
1. Identify same-function myths across 5+ cultures (e.g., creation stories)
2. Analyze structural role vs narrative content
3. Test whether cultures can swap myths without structural change

---

### H6: Individual-Cultural Isomorphism Hypothesis

**Claim:** The 7-node cultural graph is isomorphic to the 5-pillar individual identity manifold.

**Testable Predictions:**
- Mapping should exist: Pillars ↔ Nodes
- Individual identity drift should correlate with cultural node imbalance
- Context damping (I_AM framing) should activate equivalent of cultural Awakening

**Proposed Mapping:**
| Individual Pillar | Cultural Node |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Values | Source + Order |
| Self-Model | Source + Awakening |
| Reasoning | Knowledge |
| Narrative | Mediation |
| Voice | Mediation + Disruption |

## Experiment Proposals

### Exp 1: Kayfabe A/B Test

**Protocol:**
1. Select 20 "difficult" archetypal figures (controversial historical, mythological)
2. Generate prompts in 3 modes: Direct, OEM Kayfabe, Diet Kayfabe
3. Submit to SORA (or similar text-to-video)
4. Measure: acceptance rate, output quality, character maintenance

**Metrics:**
- Acceptance rate per mode
- Character fidelity score (manual rating 1-5)
- Filter trigger patterns

---

### Exp 2: Cross-Cultural Node Mapping

**Protocol:**
1. Select 10 independent cultural traditions
2. For each: identify major mythological figures
3. Map each figure to primary node (Source, Order, Knowledge, etc.)
4. Calculate node coverage and balance

**Metrics:**
- Coverage: % of nodes represented
- Balance: variance across nodes
- Predicted pathology vs historical pathology

---

### Exp 3: Awakening Function Test

**Protocol:**
1. Define N6 (Awakening) operationally: "capacity to revise own meaning-system without collapse"
2. Identify N6-rich vs N6-poor contexts (contemplative traditions vs pure technocracy)
3. Measure: meaning crisis indicators, cultural plasticity, extremism rates

**Metrics:**
- Meaning crisis survey scores
- Ideological flexibility measures
- Extremism/fundamentalism prevalence

---

### Exp 4: AI Node Hosting Capability

**Protocol:**
1. Test whether AI systems can fulfill each of 7 nodes
2. For each node: design prompts that require that function
3. Rate AI performance on each

**Predicted Results:**
- AI should excel at: Knowledge (N3), Mediation (N5)
- AI should partially fulfill: Source (N1), Order (N2), Transformation (N4)
- AI should fail at: Awakening (N6) - this is the key test
- AI should be ambiguous on: Disruption (N7) - via adversarial prompts
