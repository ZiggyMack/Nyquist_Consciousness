## Research Question

**Core Hypothesis:** LLM identity dynamics (PFI, drift, settling time) correlate with human cognitive/physiological measures during identity perturbation tasks.

**The Central Bet:**
> "If LLMs are trained on human-generated text, they should exhibit temporal signatures of identity maintenance similar to those found in human cognition."

## Key Questions to Resolve

1. What identity perturbation task works for BOTH humans and LLMs?
2. What's the human equivalent of "drift"?
3. How do we map different time scales (probes vs seconds)?
4. What IRB considerations apply to identity perturbation studies?

## The Interesting Failure Mode

**What if correlation is ZERO?**

That would still be scientifically interesting - it would mean LLMs have developed their own NON-human temporal signatures of identity, emergent from training rather than mirroring human cognition.
