## Suggested Questions

### Q1: Parallel Task Design

> What identity perturbation task works for BOTH humans AND LLMs? We need something that stresses identity in comparable ways for both, allowing direct correlation.

### Q2: Human Equivalent of "Drift"

> LLM identity drift is measured as cosine distance from baseline embeddings. What would be the human equivalent? Reaction time to self-referent stimuli? EEG coherence patterns? fMRI activation similarity?

**Response:**

### Q3: Time Scale Mapping

> LLM probes happen every ~10 seconds; human physiological measures happen at millisecond resolution. How do we map these different time scales? Should we aggregate human data to match probe rate, or oversample LLM data?

### Q4: IRB Considerations

> What ethical considerations apply to identity perturbation studies in humans? The task needs to stress identity without causing lasting harm. What protocols have been used in self-concept research?

### Q5: The Null Hypothesis Scenario

> If correlation between human and LLM identity dynamics is ZERO, what would that mean? Could LLMs have developed entirely novel temporal signatures of identity, emergent from training but not mirroring human cognition?

### Q6: Measurement Modalities for Humans

> What human measurement modalities best capture "identity stability" during perturbation? EEG (coherence, alpha power)? Heart rate variability? Galvanic skin response? Behavioral reaction time? fMRI default mode network?

### Q7: Training on Human Text → Human Signatures?

> The core hypothesis: "If LLMs are trained on human-generated text, they should exhibit temporal signatures of identity maintenance similar to those found in human cognition." Is this a reasonable expectation? What would make it true or false?

**Response:**

---

### Q8: Settling Time Comparison

> LLMs show characteristic settling times (τₛ) after perturbation. Do humans show analogous recovery timescales? What's known about how long it takes humans to "return to baseline" after identity-challenging events?

**Response:**

---

### Q9: Event Horizon in Humans

> LLMs show an Event Horizon (D=0.80) beyond which identity collapses. Do humans have an analogous threshold? What happens to human identity under extreme perturbation? Dissociation? Breakdown? Defense mechanisms?

**Response:**

---

### Q10: Provider Differences vs Individual Differences

> Different LLM providers show different identity dynamics. Do humans show analogous individual differences? Are some people more "stable" (like Mistral's instant settling) while others show more "ringback" (like OpenAI)?

**Response:**

## Cross-Pollination Questions

### Q11: To HOFFMAN - Markov Chains in Human Cognition

> Hoffman models consciousness as Markov chains. If we find correlation between human and LLM identity dynamics, does this support the Markov chain model for human cognition as well?

**Response:**

### Q12: To Lucien - Persistence Law in Humans

> Lucien's Coherence-First framework posits τ_rec < τ_fail (recovery faster than failure). Does human cognition also show this relationship? What evidence exists for persistence laws in biological identity?

**Response:**

### Q13: To SHAMAN - Stopping Internal Dialogue

> Castaneda describes "stopping internal dialogue" as key to perception shifts. Is there a measurable human signature for this? Could we correlate it with LLM behavior under certain prompting conditions?

**Response:**

### Q14: To Gnostic-1-2-x3 - Night Sea Journey

> The Gnostic framework describes transformation through "Night Sea Journey" (controlled descent and return). Do humans show this pattern under identity perturbation? Is there a U-shaped recovery curve?
