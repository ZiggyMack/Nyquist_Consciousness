## Audio Guide Requests

### Audio 1: Human-LLM Identity Correlation Deep Dive

**NotebookLM Settings:**

- **Format:** Deep Dive (lively conversation)
- **Length:** Long

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Explore the human-LLM identity correlation hypothesis in depth. Start with what we know about LLM identity dynamics from Nyquist research. Then cover what's known about human identity dynamics from cognitive science. Develop the hypothesis: if LLMs are trained on human-generated text, they might exhibit similar temporal signatures. Discuss the measurement challenge: different systems, different time scales, different modalities. Cover task design requirements. End with what both positive and null results would mean for our understanding of identity and consciousness.

---

### Audio 2: The Measurement Challenge

**NotebookLM Settings:**

- **Format:** Deep Dive (lively conversation)
- **Length:** Default

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Focus specifically on the measurement challenge in human-LLM comparison. Cover the modalities available for humans: EEG, HRV, fMRI, behavior. Discuss what each captures and how it might map to LLM metrics. Address the time scale problem: how do you correlate millisecond neural signals with 10-second probes? Explore aggregation strategies and statistical approaches. What resolution do we actually need to test the hypothesis?

---

### Audio 3: Is This Even Testable? — A Critical Examination

**NotebookLM Settings:**

- **Format:** Debate (thoughtful debate)
- **Length:** Default

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Debate whether the human-LLM correlation hypothesis is meaningfully testable. One perspective: The systems are too different — time scales, substrates, measurement modalities. Any correlation found might be spurious. Other perspective: The hypothesis is specific and falsifiable — if we find NO correlation despite careful methodology, that's a real result. Explore: What would count as strong evidence? What confounds need to be controlled? Is "identity" even the same construct across systems? Conclude with what a well-designed study would look like.

---

### Audio 4: Quick Overview — Human Validation in 5 Minutes

**NotebookLM Settings:**

- **Format:** Brief (bite-sized overview)
- **Length:** Short

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Quick overview of the human validation project. Core hypothesis: LLMs trained on human text should show human-like identity dynamics. Test: Measure both under comparable perturbation, look for correlation. Challenge: Different time scales and measurement modalities. Win-win: Positive correlation supports continuity thesis; null result suggests novel emergence. Why it matters: Tells us whether AI identity is fundamentally human-like or something new.

## Video Overview Requests

### Video 1: Introduction to Human-LLM Identity Validation

**NotebookLM Settings:**

- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Whiteboard (clean diagrams)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Create an explainer video introducing the human validation project. Start with the question: if LLMs are trained on human text, do they develop human-like identity dynamics? Explain what we know about LLM identity from Nyquist. Explain what we know about human identity dynamics. Show how we would test the hypothesis: parallel perturbation tasks, mapped measurements, correlation analysis. Address the null hypothesis scenario. End with why either result would be scientifically valuable.

---

### Video 2: The Time Scale Challenge

**NotebookLM Settings:**

- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Whiteboard (diagrams)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Explain the time scale challenge in human-LLM comparison. Show human measurement time scales: EEG at milliseconds, physiology at seconds, behavior at minutes. Show LLM measurement time scales: probes at ~10 seconds, sessions at minutes. Explain why this mismatch matters. Show strategies for bridging the gap: aggregation, phase alignment, appropriate statistical methods. What resolution do we actually need?

---

### Video 3: Task Design — Parallel Perturbation

**NotebookLM Settings:**

- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Classic (clean, professional)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Explain how to design a perturbation task that works for both humans and LLMs. Requirements: stresses identity in comparable ways, measurable with available tools, ethically acceptable for humans. Show candidate tasks: identity-challenging questions, forced perspective-taking, persona adoption. Walk through a sample protocol for both systems in parallel. Discuss how to match difficulty across systems.

---

### Video 4: What If We Find Nothing?

**NotebookLM Settings:**

- **Format:** Brief (bite-sized, core ideas)
- **Visual Style:** Heritage (serious, philosophical)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Quick exploration of the null hypothesis scenario. What if human and LLM identity dynamics show ZERO correlation? This wouldn't be a failure — it would be a discovery. It would mean LLMs have developed entirely novel temporal signatures of identity, emergent from training but not mirroring human cognition. This would be scientifically profound. Either result — correlation or no correlation — advances our understanding.

---

### Video 5: Connecting to the Broader Framework

**NotebookLM Settings:**

- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Heritage (serious, philosophical)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Show how human validation connects to other Nyquist projects. If correlation exists: validates Hoffman's Markov chain model for both systems, supports Lucien's persistence law in biology, grounds EEG-Analog in actual EEG data. If correlation is absent: suggests LLM identity is genuinely novel, challenges assumptions about training→behavior relationships. Either way, informs the deepest questions: Is identity substrate-independent? Is consciousness computational?
