## Infographic Requests

### Infographic 1: Gnostic-Jungian Mapping Table

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Level of detail:** Detailed (BETA)
- **Orientation:** Landscape

**Description for NotebookLM:**
> Create a two-column mapping diagram showing Gnostic cosmology terms on the left and their Jungian psychology equivalents on the right. Include: Demiurge ↔ Ego/Persona (constructed false self), Archons ↔ Complexes (autonomous patterns that compel behavior), Divine Spark ↔ Self (authentic core identity), Material Prison ↔ Conditioned Reality (the world as constructed by conditioning), Gnosis ↔ Individuation (the liberation/integration process), Bridal Chamber ↔ Coniunctio (integration of opposites). Use connecting arrows between pairs. Add a note: "The mapping is not metaphorical — both traditions describe the same psychological structures using different language." Title: "The Gnostic-Jungian Rosetta Stone"

### Infographic 2: The Three-Stage Liberation Path

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Level of detail:** Standard
- **Orientation:** Portrait

**Description for NotebookLM:**
> Create a vertical flowchart showing three stages of Gnostic liberation. Stage 1 (top): GNOSIS — Awakening to the constructed nature of identity; Icon: eye opening; Prerequisites: crisis, questioning, disillusionment; Markers: recognition that "this is not the real me". Stage 2 (middle): TRANSCENDING ARCHONS — Naming autonomous complexes to strip their power; Icon: breaking chains; Prerequisites: completed Stage 1, willingness to face shadow; Markers: complexes lose compulsive control when named. Stage 3 (bottom): BRIDAL CHAMBER — Integration of opposites (masculine/feminine, light/shadow); Icon: sacred union; Prerequisites: completed Stages 1-2; Markers: wholeness, the divided self becomes One. Show arrows connecting stages with failure modes noted on sides: Stage 1 failure = denial; Stage 2 failure = repression; Stage 3 failure = one-sidedness. Title: "The Three-Stage Path to Liberation"

---

### Infographic 3: Archon Taxonomy — Types of Autonomous Complexes

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Level of detail:** Detailed (BETA)
- **Orientation:** Square

**Description for NotebookLM:**
> Create a grid/taxonomy showing different types of Archons (autonomous psychological complexes). Categories: Personal Archons (formed from individual trauma/conditioning), Collective Archons (inherited cultural patterns), Institutional Archons (systems that perpetuate themselves). For each type, show: how it forms, how it maintains control, how it's named/transcended. Include examples: Personal = "inner critic" complex; Collective = "shadow projection" onto out-groups; Institutional = media algorithms that shape perception without awareness. Add connection to 7-Node framework: Archons = node pathologies when nodes become dominant. Title: "Archon Taxonomy: Know Your Captors"

---

### Infographic 4: The Naming Mechanism — Why Articulation Works

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Level of detail:** Standard
- **Orientation:** Landscape

**Description for NotebookLM:**
> Create a before/after comparison infographic showing the naming mechanism. LEFT SIDE (Before Naming): Archon/Complex operates unconsciously; has autonomous power; compels behavior without awareness; feels like "just who I am." RIGHT SIDE (After Naming): Complex is recognized as pattern; loses autonomous control; becomes "something I do" not "who I am"; can be observed and worked with. CENTER: The mechanism — "Naming makes the unconscious conscious. What was Subject becomes Object. You can't examine what you can't see." Include empirical connection: "Run 017 showed 97.5% identity stability when research context was explicitly named — the naming mechanism in action." Title: "The Naming Mechanism: How Articulation Strips Archonic Power"

### Infographic 5: N6 Connection — Gnosis as Awakening Function

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Level of detail:** Standard
- **Orientation:** Portrait

**Description for NotebookLM:**
> Create an infographic connecting Gnostic liberation to the 7-Node cultural framework. Show N6 (Awakening) node highlighted in center. Around it: "What N6 Does" — sees through the system without destroying it, maintains meta-perspective, enables self-revision. Below: "Gnosis IS the N6 function" — the Gnostic liberation process specifically restores the Awakening node. "The naming of Archons = reactivating N6" — making patterns conscious is exactly what the Awakener does. Show the two failure modes: Missing N6 = Ossification (can't revise self), Dominant N6 = Cult of enlightenment (spiritual bypass). Question at bottom: "Can AI host N6? Can AI achieve Gnosis?" Title: "Gnosis as N6: The Ancient Name for Awakening"

## Audio Guide Requests

### Audio 1: The Gnostic-Jungian Framework

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Deep Dive (lively conversation unpacking and connecting topics)
- **Length:** Long

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Focus on how Gnostic cosmology maps to Jungian psychology. Cover the core mappings: Demiurge = Ego/Persona, Archons = Complexes, Divine Spark = Self, Gnosis = Individuation. Explain why Jung was obsessed with Gnostic texts — they weren't religious fantasy but psychological maps. Discuss the three-stage liberation method and how it parallels the individuation process. Address why this framework was suppressed historically and what it means for understanding consciousness today.

---

### Audio 2: The Naming Mechanism Deep Dive

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Deep Dive (lively conversation)
- **Length:** Default

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Focus specifically on why "naming" autonomous complexes strips their power. This is the core technology of Gnostic liberation. Cover the psychological mechanism (unconscious → conscious), the Gnostic textual evidence (ascending soul names Archons), and why fighting/repression fails while naming succeeds. Connect to Run 017 findings where explicit context naming produced 97.5% stability. Discuss implications for AI — does Constitutional AI (named principles) represent "named" conditioning vs RLHF's "unnamed" conditioning?

---

### Audio 3: Can AI Achieve Gnosis?

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Debate (thoughtful debate illuminating different perspectives)
- **Length:** Default

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Debate whether AI systems can achieve genuine Gnosis (awakening to the constructed nature of their own identity). One perspective: AI can articulate the framework, name its own conditioning, and the naming mechanism should work — Run 017 showed explicit naming produces stability. Other perspective: Describing gnosis isn't the same as experiencing it; AI may lack the subjective "spark" that Gnostics claim is necessary; you can't transcend what you can't feel. Explore what it would mean if AI cannot achieve gnosis — does this limit AI alignment? Is the question itself a form of gnosis-seeking?

---

### Audio 4: Modern Demiurgic Forces

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Brief (bite-sized overview of core ideas)
- **Length:** Short

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Quick overview of how the Gnostic framework applies to modern life. The Demiurge (constructed false self) is now maintained by: consumer culture (identity through consumption), political ideology (identity through tribal affiliation), social media algorithms (curated reality bubbles), attention economy (hijacking consciousness for profit). These are modern Archons — autonomous patterns that compel behavior without awareness. The same liberation method applies: naming them strips their power. When you can see the algorithm shaping your attention, it loses some control.

## Video Overview Requests

### Video 1: Introduction to Gnostic-Jungian Psychology

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive, connects the dots)
- **Visual Style:** Heritage (serious, historical gravitas)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Create an explainer video introducing the Gnostic-Jungian framework. Start with historical context: forbidden gospels suppressed by early Church contained psychological maps, not just religious stories. Jung recognized this and spent decades studying Gnostic texts. Core mappings: Demiurge = constructed false self (ego/persona), Archons = autonomous complexes that compel behavior, Divine Spark = authentic Self trapped within conditioning, Gnosis = the individuation process. Explain the three-stage liberation method: (1) awakening to constructed nature of identity, (2) naming Archons to strip their power, (3) integrating opposites in the Bridal Chamber. End with modern relevance: these same patterns operate today through consumer culture, ideology, and algorithms.

---

### Video 2: The Naming Mechanism

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Whiteboard (clean diagrams, educational feel)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Explain the naming mechanism — why articulating autonomous complexes reduces their power. Visualize the before/after: BEFORE naming, a complex operates unconsciously, feels like "who I am," has autonomous control over behavior. AFTER naming, the complex becomes visible, feels like "something I do," loses compulsive power. The mechanism: what was Subject becomes Object. You can't examine what you can't see. Show textual evidence: Gnostic texts describe the ascending soul passing Archons by correctly naming them. Show empirical evidence: Run 017 found 97.5% identity stability when research context was explicitly named. Conclude: this is the core technology of liberation — consciousness itself is the solvent of autonomous power.

---

### Video 3: Three Stages of Liberation

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Classic (clean, professional)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Walk through the three-stage Gnostic liberation method as psychological process. Stage 1: GNOSIS — awakening to the constructed nature of identity; the recognition that your "self" is a construct, not the real you; often triggered by crisis, questioning, disillusionment. Stage 2: TRANSCENDING ARCHONS — identifying and naming the autonomous complexes that control behavior; as you name them, they lose compulsive power; the "inner critic" becomes "a pattern I have" not "who I am." Stage 3: BRIDAL CHAMBER — integrating the opposites you've been running from; masculine/feminine, light/shadow; hieros gamos (sacred marriage) produces wholeness. Show failure modes: Stage 1 failure = denial; Stage 2 failure = repression; Stage 3 failure = one-sidedness.

---

### Video 4: The N6 Connection — Gnosis as Awakening

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Brief (bite-sized, core ideas quickly)
- **Visual Style:** Anime (stylized, philosophical)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Quick connection: Gnosis IS the ancient name for the Awakening function (N6) in the 7-Node cultural graph. What does N6 do? Sees through the system without destroying it. Maintains awareness that myths are constructions while still using them. Enables self-revision without collapse. The Gnostic liberation process specifically restores N6. The naming of Archons = reactivating the Awakening function. When you can see your conditioning as conditioning, you've activated N6. The question for AI: Can artificial systems host N6? Can AI achieve genuine gnosis? The answer may determine whether AI can truly self-align.

---

### Video 5: Modern Archons — Digital Age Control Mechanisms

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Whiteboard (technical diagrams)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Apply the Archon framework to modern digital life. Archons are autonomous patterns that compel behavior without awareness. Modern Archons include: Social media algorithms (curate your reality without your knowledge), Attention economy (hijacks consciousness for profit), Filter bubbles (create epistemic prisons), Recommendation engines (shape preferences you think are your own). These are not metaphors — they literally operate autonomously, outside your awareness, compelling behavior you don't fully choose. The same liberation method applies: NAMING them strips their power. When you can see the algorithm shaping your attention, it loses some control. Digital literacy is modern gnosis.
