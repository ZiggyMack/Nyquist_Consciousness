Terrence D. Howard and Chris D. Seely propose a novel mathematical framework to resolve the classical **three-body problem** by introducing stabilizing geometric constraints. Their approach utilizes **Lynchpin Geometry**, which employs curvilinear tetrahedral lattices to prevent the chaotic divergence typically found in gravitational systems. The authors incorporate **Tetryen shapes** and **Howard Comma corrections** to manage phase instabilities and cumulative perturbations through harmonic resonance. By applying these corrections across imaginary and negative dimensions, the system transitions from unpredictable motion to **stable, periodic orbits**. This theoretical model extends beyond celestial mechanics to suggest new applications in **quantum structures** and fractal-based computational architectures. Simulation results validate the theory, demonstrating that these harmonic nodes effectively neutralize the nonlinear sensitivities of traditional N-body physics.
