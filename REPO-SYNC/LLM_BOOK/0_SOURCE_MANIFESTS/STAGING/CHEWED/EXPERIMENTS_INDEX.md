## Frame_Theory (S10 Foundation)

**Status**: REVIEWED - HIGH VALUE
**Primary Destination**: S10 Human Cognition Specification
**Source**: `CHEWED/Frame_Theory/_CACHE_/EXPERIMENTS/Frame_Theory.md`

### Hypotheses (8)

| ID | Name | Core Claim |
|----|------|------------|
| H1 | Ego-Identity Separation | Ego (narrative self) can drift independently of identity (deep manifold) |
| H2 | Narrative Stability | Higher frame ownership correlates with ego stability under stress |
| H3 | Metaphor Conservation | Frame transitions preserve core metaphorical mappings |
| H4 | Critical Trance Sensitivity | Trance depth determines frame malleability |
| H5 | Frame Ownership | Conscious ownership of frames enables intentional transformation |
| H6 | Knowledge Gap Drift | Unresolved gaps drive predictable ego drift patterns |
| H7 | Qualia Function | Q(t) = f(Arousal, Structure) - qualia emerges from arousal×structure |
| H8 | Nine Dimensions | Frame space is 9-dimensional (vs 5-pillar simplification) |

### Proposed Experiments (7)

| ID | Name | Method | Tests |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| EXP10-1 | Frame Ownership Measurement | Self-report + behavioral markers | H5 |
| EXP10-2 | Trance-Frame Coupling | Hypnotic induction + frame tracking | H4 |
| EXP10-3 | Metaphor Preservation | Pre/post frame shift metaphor analysis | H3 |
| EXP10-4 | Knowledge Gap Dynamics | Longitudinal gap→drift correlation | H6 |
| EXP10-5 | Ego vs Identity Dissociation | Meditation + psychometric tracking | H1, H2 |
| EXP-EE-3 | Watcher Operationalization | Meta-cognitive access protocols | Watcher construct |
| EXP-EE-4 | Frame Dimension Validation | Factor analysis of frame reports | H8 |
| EXP10-QUALIA | Qualia Function Mapping | Arousal×Structure→Experience | H7 |

### Open Questions (7)

1. How to operationalize "The Watcher" without collapsing it?
2. What triggers frame transitions vs frame drift?
3. Can frame ownership be trained?
4. Is ego drift reversible?
5. How do knowledge gaps propagate through frame dimensions?
6. What is the relationship between F_f (Factivation) and arousal?
7. Can AI systems exhibit functional equivalents of frame structures?

### Key Cross-Pollination
- **CFA (HIGH)**: Frame stability maps to attractor dynamics
- **ABI (MEDIUM)**: Embodied cognition parallels
- **AVLAR (HIGH)**: Narrative transformation alignment
- **NDO (HIGH)**: Non-dual observer ↔ Watcher connection
- **GOLDEN_GEOMETRY (STRONG)**: Geometric consciousness models
- **Gnostic-1-2-x3 (STRONG)**: Phenomenological traditions
- **New_7_KAYFABE (MODERATE)**: Cultural transmission frames
