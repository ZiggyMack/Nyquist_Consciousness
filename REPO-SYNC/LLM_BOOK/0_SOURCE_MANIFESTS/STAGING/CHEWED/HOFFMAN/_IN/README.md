In this interview, cognitive psychologist **Donald Hoffman** presents a revolutionary scientific framework suggesting that **human perception** does not reveal objective reality but acts as a **simplified interface** for survival. He argues that **spacetime and matter** are not fundamental; instead, they are projections of a deeper, infinite network of **conscious observers** interacting outside our physical dimensions. By applying **mathematical Markov chains** and his newly discovered "**trace logic**," Hoffman demonstrates how the laws of physics and the flow of time emerge from the dynamics of consciousness itself. This theory bridges the gap between **rigorous science and mystical traditions**, implying that all life originates from a **single, timeless source**. Ultimately, the discussion proposes that we are not mere physical objects, but part of an **infinite process of exploration** that transcends our current sensory limitations.
