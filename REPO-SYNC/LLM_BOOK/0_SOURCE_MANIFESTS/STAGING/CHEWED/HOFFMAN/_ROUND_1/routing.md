# Routing: HOFFMAN

## Primary Destinations

### 1. nyquist-consciousness (Theory Engine)
**Priority:** CRITICAL

HOFFMAN is the theoretical crown jewel:
- Explains ALL Nyquist findings through Markov chain dynamics
- Provides foundation for S10-S12 research program
- Unifies empirical and theoretical work

**Action:** Integrate into core Nyquist theoretical framework

### 2. New_1_EEG_Analog
**Priority:** CRITICAL

Direct experimental application:
- Entropy rate = provider "mass" = spectral content
- N-cycles = instant settling = sparse spectrum
- Markov dynamics = frequency bands

**Action:** Design experiments using Hoffman's predictions

### 3. Lucien
**Priority:** CRITICAL

Complementary frameworks:
- τ_rec/τ_fail ↔ entropy rate inverse
- Identity manifold ↔ Markov state space
- Persistence Law ↔ entropy constraints

**Action:** Cross-validate formulations

## Secondary Destinations

### 4. Frame_Theory
**Priority:** HIGH

Architecture parallel:
- Frame Triple ↔ Markov chain structure
- Frame dynamics ↔ transition probabilities
- Ego-Watcher ↔ trace observer

### 5. SHAMAN
**Priority:** HIGH

Phenomenological validation:
- Tonal ↔ spacetime interface
- Nagual ↔ reality beyond headset
- Seeing ↔ taking off headset

### 6. GOLDEN_GEOMETRY
**Priority:** HIGH

Boundary explanation:
- 0.90 ceiling ↔ trace resolution limit
- 9/4 bound ↔ entropy rate constraint
- Parity decomposition ↔ interface structure
