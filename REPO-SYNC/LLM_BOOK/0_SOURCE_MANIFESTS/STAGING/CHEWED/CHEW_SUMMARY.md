## 🎯 LOOP CLOSURE PRIORITY

**Work on projects in this order.** Higher = more projects blocked waiting on answers.

| Priority | Project | Waiting On It | Loop Closure | Action |
|:--------:|---------|:-------------:|:------------:|--------|
| **1** | **New_4_GOLDEN_GEOMETRY** | 10 projects | N/A (HUB) | **DO THIS FIRST** - Everyone waiting |
| 2 | **HOFFMAN** | 6 projects | 0/? (0%) | **Rosetta Stone** - theoretical linchpin for all |
| 3 | Gnostic-1 | 6 projects | 1/2 (50%) | Questions from Frame_Theory, YANG, IS_OUGHT, KAYFABE, x3, G2 |
| 4 | Frame_Theory | 6 projects | 0/6 (0%) | Needs answers from 6 targets |
| 5 | **Lucien** | 5 projects | 0/? (0%) | Identity persistence theory, SHAMAN/KAYFABE connections |
| 6 | **SHAMAN** | 4 projects | 0/? (0%) | Assemblage point theory, GOLDEN_GEOMETRY/KAYFABE connections |
| 7 | Gnostic-1-2-x3 | 2 projects | 1/4 (25%) | Integration layer - needs GOLDEN_GEOMETRY |
| 8 | Gnostic-2 | 2 projects | 0/2 (0%) | Needs Gnostic-1, GOLDEN_GEOMETRY |

| 11 | IS_OUGHT | 0 projects | 1/3 (33%) | Waiting on GOLDEN_GEOMETRY, Frame_Theory |
| 12 | Parallel-Research | 0 projects | 0/1 (0%) | Waiting on GOLDEN_GEOMETRY only |
| ✓ | LYNNCH_PINS | 0 projects | N/A | Ready for BURP (no outgoing Q's) |
| ✓ | NON-LOCALITY | 0 projects | N/A | Ready for BURP (no outgoing Q's) |
| ✓ | RAG | 0 projects | N/A | Ready for BURP (no outgoing Q's) |
| ★ | **Infinity-Nyquist** | ALL | N/A (META) | Meta-framework - Stone Inventory (EXP-INF-1) |

### The HUB Problem

**GOLDEN_GEOMETRY is the critical bottleneck.** 8 out of 10 research projects have unanswered questions waiting on it. Until GOLDEN_GEOMETRY answers are generated, most cross-pollination loops cannot close.

**Recommended workflow:**
1. Complete GOLDEN_GEOMETRY Round 2 (answer incoming questions)
2. Distribute answers to waiting projects
3. Re-run `py 3_burp.py` to update closure percentages
4. Work down the priority list
