This documentation from **Together.ai** provides a comprehensive technical guide on constructing a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflow. It explains how to enhance large language models with **domain-specific knowledge** by retrieving pertinent data from a specialized corpus to inform the model's responses. The text outlines a three-step process involving **indexing** documents into vector embeddings, **retrieving** relevant information through similarity searches, and **generating** grounded outputs. Practical implementation is demonstrated using a **movie dataset**, where titles and overviews are processed via embedding and chat endpoints to create a cohesive story. By integrating these components, developers can minimize model hallucinations and ensure that AI agents provide **accurate, context-aware information**.
