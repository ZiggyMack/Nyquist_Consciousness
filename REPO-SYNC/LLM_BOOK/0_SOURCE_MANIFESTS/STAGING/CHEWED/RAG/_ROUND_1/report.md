### Report 3: Hallucination Reduction Mechanisms

**Type:** Analytical Report

**Prompt:**
> Analyze how RAG reduces hallucination compared to pure LLM generation. Include: (1) what types of hallucinations RAG prevents, (2) what types it doesn't prevent, (3) the role of retrieval confidence in response quality, (4) strategies for detecting when RAG fails.
