## Key Routing Insight

**GOLDEN_GEOMETRY is the mathematical substrate that unifies the entire research program.** It provides the quantitative bounds (9/4, √5, 0.90) that all other projects describe qualitatively through their respective lenses (Gnostic cosmology, shamanic epistemology, Jungian psychology, survival theory, trace logic). Round 1 achieved remarkable closure: 12 distinct projects asked questions, and all 35 questions received comprehensive NotebookLM answers. The convergence of the same constants across physics (Bell/CHSH), psychology (Demiurge/Spark), and shamanism (Tonal/Nagual) strongly suggests these are fundamental information-theoretic constraints, not domain-specific artifacts. Next steps: experimental validation (New_5_RAG) and S10 human cognition bridge.
