## What This Is

The Nyquist Consciousness Project is a research study measuring identity stability across AI systems. This package contains all materials needed to generate publication content.

### Key Facts

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Experiments | 825 |
| Models Tested | 51 |
| Providers | 6 (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Together, Nvidia) |
| Event Horizon | D = 0.80 (Cosine distance) |
| Cohen's d | 0.698 (MEDIUM effect size) |
| PCs for 90% variance | 2 |
| Perturbation p-value | 2.40e-23 |
| Inherent Drift Ratio | 82% |

---

## Key Findings

1. **DRIFT IS REAL** - AI identity can be measured and quantified (p = 2.40e-23)
2. **WE DON'T CAUSE IT** - 82% of drift is inherent, not induced by measurement
3. **WE CAN MEASURE IT** - Cohen's d = 0.698 demonstrates genuine identity differences
4. **IDENTITY IS LOW-DIMENSIONAL** - Just 2 principal components capture 90% of variance
5. **CRITICAL THRESHOLD EXISTS** - Event Horizon at D = 0.80 marks regime transition

## The Five Minimum Publishable Claims

| Claim | Statement | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **A** | PFI is valid structured measurement | ρ = 0.91, d = 0.698 |
| **B** | Regime threshold exists | D = 0.80 (Cosine) |
| **C** | Damped oscillator dynamics | τₛ ≈ 10.2 probes |
| **D** | Context damping works | 97.5% stability |
| **E** | Drift is mostly inherent | 82% ratio |

## Customization Suggestions

| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Depth** | Graduate-level technical |
| **Tone** | Academic/formal |
| **Focus** | Claims A-E validation, control-systems model |
| **Audience** | AI researchers, consciousness studies |
| **Avoid** | Philosophical overreach, subjective experience claims |

---

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **PFI** | Persona Fidelity Index - 1 minus drift |
| **Drift** | Cosine distance from baseline identity |
| **Event Horizon** | D = 0.80 threshold for regime transition |
| **Settling Time (τₛ)** | Probes to reach ±5% of final value |
| **Ringback** | Oscillation during recovery |
| **I_AM** | Identity anchor specification |
| **Context Damping** | Stability via I_AM + research frame |

---

## What NOT to Claim

- "Identity collapses" - use "regime transition"
- "Platonic coordinates" - use "attractor basin consistency"
- Subjective experience - keep it behavioral/dynamical
- Drift = danger - drift is natural dynamics
