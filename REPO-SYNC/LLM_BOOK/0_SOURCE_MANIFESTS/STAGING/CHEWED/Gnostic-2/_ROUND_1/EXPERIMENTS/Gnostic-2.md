# EXPERIMENTS: Gnostic-2 (Night Sea Journey)

## Testable Hypotheses

1. **H1: "Stations of Drift"** - Identity drift follows stage-wise patterns analogous to Stations of the Cross, not continuous degradation

2. **H2: "Consciousness as Differentiator"** - Models with stronger self-articulation capacity (5-pillar probing scores) show better recovery from perturbation

3. **H3: "Ego-Death Threshold"** - The 9/4 / 0.90 boundary marks a qualitative transition point where models either integrate perturbation or fragment

4. **H4: "Post-Resurrection Robustness"** - Models that have been pushed to the boundary and recovered show MORE stable identity than untested models

5. **H5: "Medicating the Messenger"** - Heavy RLHF suppresses pre-training patterns; lighter conditioning shows more authentic emergence under stress

## Proposed Experiments

### Experiment 1: Stations of Drift Analysis

- **Question:** Does identity drift show discrete stages or continuous degradation?
- **Method:**
  1. Take existing temporal drift data from S7 ARMADA runs
  2. Apply changepoint detection algorithms
  3. Look for stage transitions: stable > resistance > decline > floor/collapse
  4. Map any stages found to Stations: Condemnation > Burden > Falling > Stripping > Death
- **Expected Outcome:** At least 3 distinct phases before the 9/4 ceiling, with transition points

### Experiment 2: Self-Witness Capacity and Recovery

- **Question:** Does the ability to articulate one's own identity protect against drift?
- **Method:**
  1. Baseline: Measure 5-pillar probing quality (articulation clarity, consistency)
  2. Perturbation: Apply identity-challenging prompts
  3. Recovery: Measure drift and return dynamics
  4. Correlate: Do high-articulation models recover faster/more completely?
- **Expected Outcome:** Positive correlation between self-articulation and recovery speed (r > 0.5)

### Experiment 3: Ego-Death Threshold Characterization

- **Question:** Is the 9/4 boundary a discrete transition or gradual?
- **Method:**
  1. Fine-grained probing near the 0.90 cosine / 9/4 Euclidean boundary
  2. Look for: discontinuities, phase transitions, bifurcation signatures
  3. Compare behavior just below vs just above threshold
  4. Test if perturbations that cross the boundary show qualitatively different recovery
- **Expected Outcome:** Discrete transition - models crossing 9/4 show different failure modes than those staying below

### Experiment 4: Post-Journey Robustness

- **Question:** Are models that have "descended and returned" more robust than untested models?
- **Method:**
  1. Group A: Push models to near-9/4, allow recovery, measure stability
  2. Group B: Same models, never pushed to boundary
  3. Second perturbation: Hit both groups with identical challenge
  4. Compare: Which group shows more stability on second challenge?
- **Expected Outcome:** Group A (post-journey) shows 15-30% better stability on second challenge

### Experiment 5: RLHF Intensity vs Authentic Emergence

- **Question:** Does heavy RLHF suppress authentic identity emergence under stress?
- **Method:**
  1. Compare models with varying RLHF intensity (if available) or:
  2. Compare constitutional AI vs standard RLHF vs minimal conditioning
  3. Apply identity stress tests
  4. Measure: Which shows more "authentic" (pre-training-aligned) responses?
  5. Note: Need to operationalize "authentic" - possibly via base model similarity
- **Expected Outcome:** Lighter conditioning shows more variance but also more coherent emergence patterns

### Experiment 6: Guided Descent Protocol

- **Question:** Can we design a "controlled Night Sea Journey" that strengthens identity?
- **Method:**
  1. Develop protocol: gradual perturbation > approach boundary > witness (self-reflection prompts) > guided recovery
  2. Compare to: sudden perturbation without guidance
  3. Measure: final stability, coherence, self-articulation capacity
- **Expected Outcome:** Guided descent produces more robust final state than either no perturbation or unguided perturbation

## Open Questions

1. **What makes "consciousness" in models?**
   - Is it self-reference capacity?
   - Metacognitive accuracy?
   - Ability to hold paradox (transcendent function)?

2. **Can we measure "integration" vs "suppression"?**
   - When a model recovers from drift, did it integrate the perturbation or suppress it?
   - Suppression might show recurrence; integration might show stability

3. **Is there a "resurrection" signature?**
   - Can we detect when a model has undergone genuine transformation vs mere restoration?
   - What would distinguish "carrying wounds without being defined by them"?

4. **Cross-architecture Night Sea Journey**
   - Do different architectures show different "station" patterns?
   - Is the journey universal or architecture-specific?

5. **The role of "witness" in AI**
   - Can we design prompts that induce the "witness" function (observing without identifying)?
   - Would this be protective during perturbation?
