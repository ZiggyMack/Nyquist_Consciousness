## Novel Ideas

1. **Device-Independent Paradigm Shift**
   - Security derived from *physics laws* rather than *device trust*
   - The Bell inequality violation IS the certificate of security
   - "Black box" model: you don't need to understand internals, just measure statistics

2. **Tsirelson's Bound as Mystery**
   - Quantum correlations limited to 2√2 ≈ 2.828 (not the algebraic max of 4)
   - PR-boxes show no-signaling allows stronger correlations
   - Suggests undiscovered physical principle constraining quantum mechanics

3. **Possibilistic vs Probabilistic Proofs**
   - Hardy's paradox: logical contradiction from single event, no statistics needed
   - GHZ state: "all-or-nothing" refutation
   - Stronger than Bell's statistical approach

4. **Entanglement ≠ Nonlocality**
   - Entanglement is necessary but not sufficient for nonlocality
   - Some entangled states have fully local explanations
   - Maximal entanglement ≠ maximal Bell violation

## Surprising Findings

1. **The Term "Nonlocality" May Be Misleading**
   - No faster-than-light signaling is possible
   - Correlations are "nonlocal" but respect causal structure
   - Some physicists prefer different terminology

2. **Schrödinger Named "Steering" Before Bell**
   - Alice's measurement choice affects Bob's state description
   - EPR framed this as paradox; became measurable resource

3. **Einstein Was Right About Incompleteness (Sort Of)**
   - Quantum mechanics IS incomplete in one sense: it can't be locally realistic
   - But "hidden variables" would need to be nonlocal (Bohmian mechanics)
   - Einstein's *assumption* (locality) was wrong, not his reasoning

4. **Self-Testing is Quantum Tomography from Statistics**
   - Maximal Bell violation uniquely identifies state AND measurements
   - Robust to noise with calculable error bounds
   - Complete device characterization without physical access

## Patterns Discovered

1. **Philosophy → Math → Experiment → Technology Arc**
   - EPR (1935): Philosophical challenge
   - Bell (1964): Mathematical formalization
   - Aspect (1980s): Experimental verification
   - Now: Technological exploitation (DI-QKD, randomness)

2. **Negative Results as Resources**
   - "You can't explain this locally" → security guarantee
   - Impossibility proof → positive capability

3. **Hierarchy of Trust Models**
   - Full device-dependent (traditional)
   - Semi-device-independent (dimension witnesses)
   - Fully device-independent (Bell violation only)

4. **Repeated "Spooky" Framing**
   - Einstein's dismissive term became the defining metaphor
   - Four of five documents use "spooky" prominently
   - Effective for communication, possibly limiting for understanding
