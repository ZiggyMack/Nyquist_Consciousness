**Quantum nonlocality** describes a feature of the universe where certain measurement results cannot be explained by **local realism**, meaning the outcomes are not determined solely by local factors. While first proposed as a paradox by **Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen** to suggest quantum mechanics was incomplete, later work by **John Bell** proved that no local hidden variables could replicate quantum predictions. Experimental evidence, such as violations of the **CHSH inequality**, has since confirmed that these distant correlations are a fundamental reality. Importantly, this phenomenon does not permit **faster-than-light communication**, ensuring it remains consistent with the principles of **special relativity**. Beyond theoretical debate, nonlocality is now utilized in **device-independent protocols** for secure cryptography and certified randomness. Although often associated with **entanglement**, it is distinct because it relies strictly on observable statistics rather than specific mathematical models.
