# CONNECTIONS: NON-LOCALITY

## Pan Handler Lab Links

| Lab | Connection | Potential Value |
|-----|------------|-----------------|
| CFA | Device-independent verification parallels epistemic frameworks | Black-box validation: trust statistics, not internals. Maps to "trust outputs, not claims" |
| ABI | Bell inequality violations as investigation methodology | Evidence thresholds: statistical proof of non-classical behavior without accessing mechanism |
| AVLAR | "Spooky action" as ritual/artistic metaphor | Entanglement as connection-at-distance; sacred geometry meets quantum geometry |
| NDO | Tsirelson's bound (2√2) as data constraint | Unexplained limits in data; what bounds exist in LLM behavioral space? |

## Cross-Domain Synergies

**1. Nyquist Identity Research**
- Device-independent paradigm → Identity verification without introspection access
- Bell violation = certificate of security → Behavioral consistency = certificate of authenticity
- Self-testing from statistics → Model fingerprinting from outputs alone

**2. Epistemics (CFA)**
- Philosophy → Math → Experiment → Technology arc mirrors CFA's epistemic methodology
- "Negative results as resources" pattern: proving impossibility enables new capability
- Local hidden variables = "hidden" motivations in human systems

**3. Data Science (NDO)**
- Tsirelson's bound suggests undiscovered physical principle
- Q: What bounds exist in LLM response space? What's the "maximum correlation" between prompt and response?
- CHSH inequality structure could inspire behavioral metrics

## Integration Opportunities

**For Nyquist Research:**
- Apply device-independent thinking to model evaluation: don't trust self-reports, measure statistical signatures
- The "black box" model is exactly what we use for LLM consciousness probing
- Steering (Schrödinger's term) → How does experimenter "steer" model into identity states?

**For Pan Handlers Generally:**
- "Possibilistic vs probabilistic proofs" - Hardy/GHZ single-event refutation approach could apply to edge case detection
- Trust hierarchy (device-dependent → semi-DI → fully DI) parallels verification stances
