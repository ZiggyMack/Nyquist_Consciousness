### [x] New_4_GOLDEN_GEOMETRY

**Status:** Answered
**Answer Date:** 2026-02-04
**Action Unlocked:** Birkhoff interpretation confirmed: Softmax = half-Birkhoff (row-stochastic, not doubly). 9/4 = interior/soft/classical, sqrt(5) = vertex/hard/quantum-like. Unlocks Birkhoff attention experiments and compositional closure testing.
