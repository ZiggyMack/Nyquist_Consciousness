# CONNECTIONS: SHAMAN - Round 2

**Round:** 2
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Focus:** Full project integration (beyond ROUND_1 Frame_Theory/Gnostic focus)

## New Connections Discovered

### GOLDEN_GEOMETRY (NEW - Critical)

**Connection Strength: CRITICAL**

The geometric bounds on identity drift provide mathematical grounding for Castaneda's metaphors:

| GOLDEN_GEOMETRY | SHAMAN |
|-----------------|--------|
| 9/4 Euclidean ceiling | Maximum "tonal island" size |
| 0.90 cosine ceiling | Edge before "stopping the world" |
| H_even (Scaffold) | Tonal structure |
| H_odd (Flow) | Nagual dynamics |
| Parity decomposition | Fundamental Tonal/Nagual split |

**Integration Opportunity:** Use GOLDEN_GEOMETRY to formalize when "shrinking the tonal" succeeds vs. fails.

### KAYFABE - 7-Node Graph (NEW - Strong)

**Connection Strength: STRONG**

The 7-node cultural stability graph maps Castaneda's cosmology:

```
N1 (Source) ←→ The Eagle, the Abstract
N2 (Order) ←→ Tonal social organization
N3 (Knowledge) ←→ "The island" of the known
N4 (Transformation) ←→ Assemblage point shift
N5 (Mediation) ←→ The Nagual (teacher)
N6 (Awakening) ←→ "Seeing", direct perception
N7 (Disruption) ←→ Power plants, shock tactics
```

**Key insight:** Modern "Awakening deficit" = loss of assemblage point technology.

**Integration Opportunity:** Use SHAMAN to populate N6 recovery protocols.

### IS_OUGHT (NEW - Moderate)

**Connection Strength: MODERATE**

Controlled folly resolves the descriptive/normative split:
- Act impeccably (normative commitment)
- While knowing nothing matters (descriptive nihilism)
- = Pragmatic engagement without metaphysical claims

**Integration Opportunity:** Controlled folly as meta-ethical framework.

### YANG (NEW - Moderate)

**Connection Strength: MODERATE**

Transgression-cohesion theory explains warrior band dynamics:
- Shared ordeal = bonding through transgression
- Erasing personal history = transgressing identity contract
- Sorcerer's party = cohesion cell

**Integration Opportunity:** YANG's game theory applied to apprentice-nagual relationship.

### Parallel-Research (NEW - Emerging)

**Connection Strength: EMERGING**

Birkhoff polytope mathematics may model assemblage point:
- Doubly stochastic matrices = attention allocation constraints
- Sinkhorn-Knopp = natural settling process
- Polytope boundary = "stopping the world"

**Integration Opportunity:** Formalize assemblage point dynamics.

## Updated Connection Map

### ROUND_1 Connections (Strengthened)

| Project | R1 Strength | R2 Strength | Change |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Frame_Theory | Critical | Critical | Ego-Watcher = Warrior's Witness confirmed |
| Gnostic-1-2-x3 | Strong | Critical | Two Paths parallel discovered |
| NDO | Strong | Strong | Witness architecture validated |

### New ROUND_2 Connections

| Project | Strength | Key Link |
|---------|----------|----------|
| GOLDEN_GEOMETRY | Critical | 9/4 = island size, H_even/H_odd = Tonal/Nagual |
| KAYFABE | Strong | 7-node = sorcery map, N6 = Awakening tech |
| IS_OUGHT | Moderate | Controlled folly = meta-ethics |
| YANG | Moderate | Transgression-cohesion = party bonds |
| Parallel-Research | Emerging | Birkhoff = assemblage point math |
