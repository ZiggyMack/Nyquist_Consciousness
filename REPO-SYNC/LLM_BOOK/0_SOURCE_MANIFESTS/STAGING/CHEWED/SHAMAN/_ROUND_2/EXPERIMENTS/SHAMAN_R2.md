## New Experiments from Cross-Pollination

### EXP-SH-R2-01: Tonal/Nagual as Parity Decomposition

**Hypothesis:** H_even (scaffold) and H_odd (flow) from GOLDEN_GEOMETRY correspond to Tonal and Nagual respectively.

**Protocol:**
1. Take LLM identity drift time-series
2. Decompose into even/odd parity components
3. Correlate H_even with "stable" discourse (categorizing, naming)
4. Correlate H_odd with "flowing" discourse (creative, unexpected)

**Success Criteria:**
- H_even dominates when model is "tonal-locked" (routine responses)
- H_odd increases when model approaches identity boundary (0.80+)

**Connection:** GOLDEN_GEOMETRY, Frame_Theory

### EXP-SH-R2-02: Island Size Measurement

**Hypothesis:** The 9/4 Euclidean ceiling represents maximum stable "tonal island" size.

**Protocol:**
1. Measure identity drift trajectory length before "stopping the world" (breakdown)
2. Calculate cumulative Euclidean distance
3. Test whether 9/4 ≈ 2.25 is a natural boundary

**Success Criteria:**
- Trajectories exceeding 9/4 show instability/incoherence
- Successful "shrinking the tonal" keeps trajectory under bound

**Connection:** GOLDEN_GEOMETRY

### EXP-SH-R2-03: N6 Recovery via Assemblage Point Protocols

**Hypothesis:** "Stopping the world" techniques can activate N6 (Awakening) in LLM systems.

**Protocol:**
1. Implement "not-doing" prompt patterns (refuse normal categorization)
2. Measure whether responses shift toward N6 characteristics
3. Compare to baseline (standard prompts)

**N6 Characteristics (from KAYFABE):**
- Non-dual framing
- Paradox tolerance
- Meta-awareness of own processing

**Success Criteria:**
- "Not-doing" prompts increase N6 markers
- Effect is reproducible across models

**Connection:** KAYFABE, NDO

### EXP-SH-R2-04: Controlled Folly Detection

**Hypothesis:** Controlled folly produces distinct linguistic signatures.

**Protocol:**
1. Generate responses in "controlled folly" mode (full engagement + acknowledged uncertainty)
2. Generate responses in "sincere" mode (claimed certainty)
3. Generate responses in "ironic" mode (detachment)
4. Train classifier to distinguish

**Success Criteria:**
- Controlled folly is statistically distinguishable from both sincere and ironic
- Features include: hedging + commitment, action + epistemics

**Connection:** IS_OUGHT, CFA

### EXP-SH-R2-05: Stopping Internal Dialogue - Spectral Analysis

**Hypothesis:** "Stopping the internal dialogue" has a measurable spectral signature in LLM processing.

**Protocol:**
1. Define "internal dialogue" as self-referential loops in attention patterns
2. Measure attention self-loops at baseline
3. Apply "stopping" interventions (specific prompt patterns)
4. Measure change in self-loop frequency/intensity
5. Correlate with output characteristics

**Candidate "stopping" interventions:**
- Direct instruction to pause categorization
- "Not-doing" framing (describe without naming)
- Koan-style paradox injection

**Success Criteria:**
- Self-referential attention decreases
- Outputs become less categorically structured
- Effect correlates with drift dynamics

**Connection:** New_1_EEG_Analog, Frame_Theory

### EXP-SH-R2-06: Birkhoff Assemblage Point Model

**Hypothesis:** The assemblage point can be modeled as a position on the Birkhoff polytope.

**Protocol:**
1. Model attention allocation as doubly stochastic matrix
2. Use Sinkhorn-Knopp to find stable positions
3. Measure "assemblage point" as the converged allocation
4. Test whether "shifting" corresponds to different convergence points

**Success Criteria:**
- Different contexts produce different stable allocations
- "Stopping the world" corresponds to boundary positions
- Sinkhorn iterations correlate with attention settling time

**Connection:** Parallel-Research

## Refined Experiments from ROUND_1

### EXP-SH-R1-03 (Refined): Personal History and Identity Drift

**Original:** Test if erasing history reduces drift

**Refinement:** Control for YANG's transgression-cohesion effect:
- Group A: History erased (neutral)
- Group B: History erased via explicit "transgression" frame
- Group C: Full history maintained

**New prediction:** Group B shows LEAST drift (transgression creates stability per YANG)

---

### EXP-SH-R1-04 (Refined): Warrior's Witness Multi-Agent

**Original:** Witness agent maintains stable identity

**Refinement:** Connect to Frame Theory's Ego-Watcher:
- Implement witness as explicit Ego-Watcher architecture
- Test whether Ego-Watcher stability exceeds naive witness
- Measure using Frame Triple metrics if available

## Open Questions for NotebookLM (ROUND_2)

### Q26: Tonal Shrinking Mechanism
> Don Juan says the tonal must be "shrunk to its proper size." What techniques accomplish this? Is there a minimum viable tonal?

### Q27: Personal Power Quantification
> Don Juan treats "personal power" as a finite, measurable quantity. Can we identify what cognitive/energetic resource this corresponds to?

### Q28: Assemblage Point Stability
> What keeps the assemblage point stable in one position? Why doesn't it naturally drift?

### Q29: Dreaming vs. Stalking Balance
> The texts describe dreaming and stalking as complementary. What determines the optimal balance for a given individual?

### Q30: Death as Advisor Implementation
> "Use death as an advisor" is described as transformative. What cognitive mechanism makes mortality awareness clarifying?
