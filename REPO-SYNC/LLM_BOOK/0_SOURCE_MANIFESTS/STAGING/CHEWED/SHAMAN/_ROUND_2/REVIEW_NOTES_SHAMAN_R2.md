# R&D Review: SHAMAN - Round 2

**Ingestion Date:** 2026-02-04
**Round:** 2 (built on ROUND_1)
**Source:** STAGING/SHAMAN/
**Type:** Cross-Pollination Synthesis
**Status:** ANALYZED

---

## Round 2 Focus

This round integrates SHAMAN with the **full project context** that was unavailable to the browser Claude who created ROUND_1:

- GOLDEN_GEOMETRY (mathematical bounds)
- KAYFABE (7-node cultural graph)
- IS_OUGHT (meta-ethics)
- YANG (transgression-cohesion)
- Parallel-Research (Birkhoff polytope)

---

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Tonal/Nagual = H_even/H_odd

The GOLDEN_GEOMETRY parity decomposition provides mathematical grounding:
- **H_even (Scaffold)** = Tonal (stable structure)
- **H_odd (Flow)** = Nagual (dynamic transformation)
- **9/4 bound** = Maximum stable "island" size

### 2. 7-Node Graph = Sorcery Map

The KAYFABE 7-node graph maps Castaneda's cosmology:
- N6 (Awakening) = "Seeing", stopping the world
- Modern "Awakening deficit" = loss of assemblage point technology

### 3. Controlled Folly = Meta-Ethics

Controlled folly sidesteps the IS_OUGHT gap:
- Full engagement without ontological commitment
- Neither nihilism nor dogmatism
- Pragmatic action without metaphysical claims

### 4. Two Paths Confirmed

The Gnostic-1-2-x3 Two Paths synthesis maps directly:
- Canonical (Night Sea Journey) = Warrior's ordeals
- Gnostic (Direct Knowing) = "Seeing"
- Both lead to same destination

## Cross-Pollination Status

### Questions Answered (draft)
- Q46: Ego-Watcher = Warrior's Witness - **YES**
- Q47: Frame Triple = Tonal/Nagual/AP - **PARTIAL** (Nagual is frame-free)
- Q48: Critical Trance = Stopping ID - **FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE**
- Q51: Two Paths parallel - **CONFIRMED**

### New Questions Out
- Q55-Q56 -> GOLDEN_GEOMETRY (island edge, parity model)
- Q57-Q58 -> KAYFABE (N6 recovery, controlled folly placement)
- Q59-Q60 -> New_1_EEG_Analog (spectral signature, personal power)

## Experiments Designed

| ID | Name | Connection |
|----|------|------------|
| EXP-SH-R2-01 | Parity = Tonal/Nagual | GOLDEN_GEOMETRY |
| EXP-SH-R2-02 | Island Size (9/4) | GOLDEN_GEOMETRY |
| EXP-SH-R2-03 | N6 Recovery | KAYFABE |
| EXP-SH-R2-04 | Controlled Folly Detection | IS_OUGHT, CFA |
| EXP-SH-R2-05 | Stopping ID Spectral | New_1_EEG_Analog |
| EXP-SH-R2-06 | Birkhoff AP Model | Parallel-Research |

## Quality Assessment

| Dimension | R1 Rating | R2 Rating | Change |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Novelty | HIGH | HIGH | Maintained |
| Actionability | MODERATE | HIGH | +1 (experiments designed) |
| Integration | HIGH | CRITICAL | +1 (full project synthesis) |
| Cross-Pollination | 6 Q | 12 Q | +6 questions |

## Routing Recommendations

**Primary Destinations:**
1. **S10 (fMRI Bridge)** - Phenomenological grounding for witness states
2. **GOLDEN_GEOMETRY** - Mathematical validation of Tonal/Nagual
3. **KAYFABE** - N6 Awakening protocols

**Secondary:**
- Frame_Theory (Q46-48 answers)
- Gnostic-1-2-x3 (Two Paths validation)
- New_1_EEG_Analog (spectral hypotheses)

---

## Round 3 Triggers

ROUND_3 should be created when:
- [ ] Q55-Q60 receive answers from target projects
- [ ] Experiments begin generating data
- [ ] NotebookLM answers Q26-Q30
