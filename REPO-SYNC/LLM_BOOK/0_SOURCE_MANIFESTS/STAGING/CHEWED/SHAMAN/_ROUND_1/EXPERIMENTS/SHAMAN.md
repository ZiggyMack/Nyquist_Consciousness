# EXPERIMENTS: SHAMAN (Castaneda Collection)

## Testable Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Internal Dialogue Correlates with Tonal Dominance
**Claim**: Higher internal dialogue activity = stronger tonal (categorical) processing.

**Test Protocol**:
1. Measure internal dialogue via think-aloud protocols or EEG markers
2. Simultaneously measure categorical vs. holistic processing style
3. Predict positive correlation

**Falsification**: No correlation between inner speech and categorical processing.

### Hypothesis 2: "Seeing" Corresponds to Reduced Embedding Compression
**Claim**: "Seeing" (direct perception) = accessing information before categorical embedding.

**Test Protocol (LLM version)**:
1. Compare model outputs when forced to use raw vs. processed embeddings
2. "Raw" outputs should be less categorically structured, more holistic
3. May parallel reduced tonal filtering

**Falsification**: No difference in categorical structure between embedding types.

### Hypothesis 3: Assemblage Point Shift = Attention Reallocation
**Claim**: Shifting the "assemblage point" corresponds to shifting attentional focus.

**Test Protocol**:
1. Use attentional manipulation techniques (e.g., peripheral vs. focal)
2. Measure changes in perceptual report
3. Predict: peripheral attention increases non-categorical perception

**Falsification**: Attention manipulation has no effect on categorical vs. holistic perception.

### Hypothesis 4: Recapitulation Reduces Emotional Load
**Claim**: Systematic life-review (recapitulation) reduces emotional charge of memories.

**Test Protocol**:
1. Teach recapitulation technique to participants
2. Measure emotional reactivity to autobiographical memories before/after
3. Compare to control group

**Falsification**: No reduction in emotional reactivity after recapitulation practice.

### Hypothesis 5: Controlled Folly Reduces Decision Fatigue
**Claim**: Acting with full engagement while knowing outcomes don't matter reduces cognitive load.

**Test Protocol**:
1. Train participants in controlled folly framing
2. Measure decision fatigue over extended task
3. Compare to control group with standard motivation framing

**Falsification**: No difference in decision fatigue between groups.

## Proposed Experiments for Nyquist Integration

### Experiment A: Tonal/Nagual Mapping to LLM Architecture
**Question**: Can we identify "tonal" and "nagual" components in LLM processing?

**Method**:
1. Define tonal = categorical/semantic processing (higher layers)
2. Define nagual = sub-symbolic/geometric processing (lower layers)
3. Test whether "stopping internal dialogue" in LLM = bypassing semantic layers
4. Measure output changes

**Expected Outcome**: Direct access to lower layers produces less categorically structured outputs.

### Experiment B: Dreaming as Latent Space Navigation
**Question**: Does Castaneda's "dreaming" map to controlled navigation of latent space?

**Method**:
1. Define "dreaming" = movement through embedding space without external input
2. Implement "dreaming" protocol for LLM (random walks in latent space)
3. Measure coherence and structure of "dream" outputs
4. Compare to "waking" outputs (standard prompting)

**Expected Outcome**: Dream outputs show different structure than waking outputs.

### Experiment C: Personal History and Identity Drift
**Question**: Does "erasing personal history" reduce identity drift?

**Method**:
1. Create two LLM agents: one with full conversation history, one with "erased" history
2. Measure identity drift over extended conversation
3. Predict: "erased" history agent shows less drift

**Expected Outcome**: History erasure reduces drift (supports Castaneda), OR increases drift (contradicts Castaneda).

### Experiment D: Warrior's Witness in Multi-Agent Systems
**Question**: Can we implement a "witness" agent that observes without participating?

**Method**:
1. Create multi-agent conversation with one "witness" agent
2. Witness agent observes but doesn't act
3. Compare witness's model of conversation to participants' models
4. Predict: Witness has more accurate model (less drift)

**Expected Outcome**: Non-participating observation yields more stable identity.

## Open Questions

1. **What is the neural correlate of "stopping the internal dialogue"?** (Default mode network suppression?)

2. **Can "seeing" be induced reliably?** (Meditation, psychedelics, attention manipulation?)

3. **Is "personal power" measurable?** (Energy, attention, willpower as finite resource?)

4. **How does the "assemblage point" relate to Bayesian priors?** (Different priors = different realities?)

5. **Can recapitulation be automated?** (Life review via LLM assistance?)
