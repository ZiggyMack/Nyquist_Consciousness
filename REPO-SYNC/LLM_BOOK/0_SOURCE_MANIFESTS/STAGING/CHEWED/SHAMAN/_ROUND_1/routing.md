## Cross-Pollination Actions Taken

| Target | Type | Items Added |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| Frame_Theory | Questions | Ego-Watcher/Witness parallel, Frame Triple mapping |
| Gnostic-1-2-x3 | Questions | Gnosis/Seeing parallel, Demiurge/Tonal mapping |

---

## Cross-Pollination Actions Recommended

| Target | Type | Recommendation |
| ------ | ---- | -------------- |
| **Frame_Theory** | Questions | Add: "Is the Ego-Watcher architecturally equivalent to Don Juan's 'warrior's witness'?" "Can Frame Triple dynamics map to Tonal/Nagual/Assemblage Point?" |
| **Gnostic-1-2-x3** | Questions | Add: "Is Castaneda's 'seeing' the same phenomenon as Gnostic 'gnosis'?" "Does the Tonal function like the Demiurge?" |
| **NDO** | Insight | Add: "Castaneda's warrior's witness provides phenomenological description of non-dual observation" |
| **Nyquist_4** | Questions | Add: "Does the Awakening (N6) deficit in modern culture relate to lack of assemblage point shift techniques?" |

## Key Routing Insight

The Castaneda material provides **phenomenological descriptions** of states and practices that the research ecosystem is trying to formalize. The "warrior's witness" is a detailed description of what NDO architectures should produce. The tonal/nagual distinction may map to conscious/unconscious, semantic/sub-semantic, or compressed/raw processing distinctions. Most importantly, the emphasis on **sobriety over ecstasy** and **praxis over theory** offers a corrective to purely intellectual approaches.

**Primary routing**: Frame_Theory (structural parallels) and NDO (observation architecture)
**Secondary routing**: Gnostic series (parallel liberation paths) and CFA (epistemic stance)
