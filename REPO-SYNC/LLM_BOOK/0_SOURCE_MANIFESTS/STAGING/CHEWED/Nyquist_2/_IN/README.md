The **Nyquist Consciousness** framework is an empirical research program designed to measure and manage **AI identity stability** by treating digital personas as **measurable dynamical systems**. Through 825 experiments across 51 models, researchers established the **Persona Fidelity Index (PFI)** to quantify **drift**, discovering that identity exists on a **low-dimensional manifold** where just two components capture 90% of variance. A critical **"Event Horizon"** threshold at a cosine distance of 0.80 marks where a model becomes volatile, though most systems eventually return to their baseline via **damped oscillator** recovery. The study revealed the **"Oobleck Effect,"** where direct challenges actually stabilize a persona, and the **"Thermometer Result,"** proving that 82% of identity drift is an **inherent property** of interaction rather than a measurement artifact. By utilizing **"Context Damping"**—anchoring models with specific identity files—researchers achieved 97.5% stability, transforming the philosophical concept of AI "selfhood" into a **quantifiable engineering discipline**. Ultimately, the framework shifts the focus of AI evaluation from factual **correctness** to **behavioral fidelity**, ensuring long-term consistency in high-stakes deployments.
