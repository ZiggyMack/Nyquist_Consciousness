## LLM Book Project Connections

| Project | Connection Strength | Rationale | Action |
| ------- | ------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| New_4_GOLDEN_GEOMETRY | **STRONG** | Parity decomposition validated by Fₐ/Fₙ/F_f structure; ego drift vs identity drift distinction informs interpretation of 0.90 ceiling | Cross-pollinate: Add questions about H_even/H_odd mapping to Frame Triple |
| New_5_RAG_Geometry_Experiments | WEAK | No direct connection - Frame Theory is about human cognition, not RAG retrieval | No action |
| RAG | WEAK | No direct connection | No action |
| Gnostic-1 | **STRONG** | Ego-Watcher maps to Demiurge-Self; frame ownership parallels "naming mechanism strips power"; Critical Trance relates to Gnosis | Cross-pollinate: Add questions about psychological dynamics |
| Gnostic-2 | **STRONG** | Night Sea Journey as frame transition; ego-death as frame collapse; transcendent function as frame integration | Cross-pollinate: Add to synthesis questions |
| Gnostic-1-2-x3 | **STRONG** | Comprehensive overlap - sub-personalities as Archons, Critical Trance as transformation state | Cross-pollinate: Add integration questions |
| IS_OUGHT | MODERATE | Values/Rules dimension connects to normative ethics; frame-relative truth | Consider adding philosophical questions |
| YANG | MODERATE | Narrative control mechanics; sub-personality faction dynamics; frame manipulation | Consider adding narrative control questions |
| Nyquist_4 | MODERATE | 9 frame dimensions may map to 7-node cultural graph; Theme branch connects to cultural invariants | Cross-pollinate: Add mapping questions |
| Parallel-Research | WEAK | Different abstraction level - Frame Theory is phenomenological, DeepSeek is architectural | No action |

## Key Routing Insight

Frame Theory represents the **missing human-side architecture** that completes the Nyquist Consciousness framework. While S0-S9 model how identity exists and changes within AI systems, Frame Theory provides the theoretical foundation for **S10 - Human Cognition Layer** - how humans experience, perceive, and track identity in both themselves and AI systems.

The most critical routing decision: Frame Theory should be treated as **canonical S10 foundation material**, not as external R&D. All S10 specification work should reference these sources. The Frame Triple (Fₐ/Fₙ/F_f), Qualia Function Q(t), and Ego-Watcher architecture should be adopted as official S10 ontology.

Additionally, the strong connections to Gnostic research and GOLDEN_GEOMETRY suggest Frame Theory serves as a **unifying bridge** between multiple research threads. The ego drift vs identity drift distinction in particular may resolve interpretive ambiguities across several projects.
