This source explores a **psychological interpretation of Jesus’s suffering**, viewing his agony in Gethsemane not as a lack of faith, but as a **profound descent into existential depression**. Drawing heavily on the theories of **Carl Jung**, the text argues that such periods of darkness represent a **necessary "Night Sea journey"** required for the death of the limited ego and the birth of a more complete self. Rather than treating depression merely as a biological malfunction to be suppressed, the author suggests it often serves as a **soul-level rebellion** against an inauthentic life. True transformation requires **maintaining consciousness** throughout this internal crisis, holding the tension between despair and hope as modeled by the Passion. Ultimately, the material posits that **wholeness necessitates integrating darkness**, suggesting that spiritual maturity is found by facing the void rather than bypassing it.
