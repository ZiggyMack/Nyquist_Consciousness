**Description for NotebookLM:**
> Create a circular network diagram showing the 7-Node Cultural Stability Graph. Arrange 7 nodes in a heptagon: N1-Source (origin/cosmology), N2-Order (governance/rules), N3-Knowledge (epistemology/science), N4-Transformation (change/death/renewal), N5-Mediation (translation/communication), N6-Awakening (self-revision/seeing through), N7-Disruption (trickster/chaos). Show edge connections between nodes with sample "myth labels" as routing examples (e.g., "Creation Story" connects N1→N2). Use a color legend: green for balanced nodes, red tint for dominant pathology, grey tint for suppressed/missing. Include a small table showing each node's failure modes (Missing vs Dominant). Title: "The 7-Node Functional Graph: Cultural Meaning Infrastructure"

---

### Infographic 2: Node Failure Mode Matrix

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Level of detail:** Standard
- **Orientation:** Portrait

**Description for NotebookLM:**
> Create a 7-row by 3-column table/matrix infographic. Column headers: "Node", "Missing = ", "Dominant = ". Rows: N1-Source (Nihilism / Dogmatic metaphysics), N2-Order (Chaos / Authoritarianism), N3-Knowledge (Superstition / Technocracy), N4-Transformation (Stagnation / Destruction fetish), N5-Mediation (Fragmentation / Propaganda), N6-Awakening (Ossification / Cult of enlightenment), N7-Disruption (Brittleness / Permanent instability).

- **Level of detail:** Standard
- **Orientation:** Landscape

**Description for NotebookLM:**
> Create a side-by-side comparison infographic contrasting OEM Kayfabe vs Diet Kayfabe. Two columns with headers. OEM Kayfabe column: Exaggerated, satirical, comic-book style; Use case = initial exploration, testing limits; Risk = can trivialize serious material; Examples = Funky Booty Brew Man, wrestling villain personas. Diet Kayfabe column: Grounded, serious, philosophical; Use case = deep inquiry, actual insights; Risk = requires careful framing; Examples = philosophers speaking directly, archetypal dialogue. Add a "progression arrow" at bottom showing evolution: Silly Gags → Cult Leaders → Historical Figures → Mythological Entities → Philosophers → Gods. Title: "The Kayfabe Spectrum: From Satire to Synthesis"

---

### Infographic 4: 5-Pillar to 7-Node Mapping (NEW)

**NotebookLM Settings:**

## Audio Guide Requests

### Audio 1: The 7-Node Framework

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Deep Dive (lively conversation unpacking and connecting topics)
- **Length:** Long

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Focus on the 7-Node Cultural Stability Graph as a framework for understanding why cultures succeed or fail. Cover each node (Source, Order, Knowledge, Transformation, Mediation, Awakening, Disruption) with concrete historical examples. Emphasize the key insight: these are functional attractors, not metaphysical truths — every viable culture must fill these roles somehow. Discuss why modern societies have suppressed N6 (Awakening) and what that means for our current meaning crisis. Make it accessible to someone unfamiliar with the framework.

---

### Audio 2: Kayfabe and Archetypes

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Deep Dive (lively conversation unpacking and connecting topics)
- **Length:** Default

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Focus on the Kayfabe discovery: how the wrestling promo format (interviewer + subject cutting a promo) became a vehicle for archetypal exploration through SORA. Explain the progression from silly gags (Funky Booty Brew Man) through cult leaders, historical figures, mythological entities, philosophers, to gods themselves. Distinguish OEM Kayfabe (exaggerated, satirical) from Diet Kayfabe (grounded, philosophical). Discuss why fiction buffers work and the ethical considerations of responsible archetypal work.

---

### Audio 3: The N6 Question — Can AI Awaken? (NEW)

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Debate (thoughtful debate illuminating different perspectives)
- **Length:** Default

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Debate whether AI systems can host the Awakening function (N6). One perspective: AI can articulate the concept precisely, describe self-revision, and perhaps naming constraints strips their power (Run 017 showed 97.5% stability with context damping). Other perspective: describing awakening isn't the same as embodying it — AI may be fundamentally limited to N3 (Knowledge), N5 (Mediation), and simulating N2 (Order). Explore what it would mean if AI cannot host N6: human-AI teams would require humans to provide the awakening function. Is the question itself the beginning of an answer?

---

### Audio 4: Individual to Collective — The Scale Bridge (NEW)

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Brief (bite-sized overview of core ideas)
- **Length:** Short

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Explain how the 5 Pillars of individual identity (Values, Self-Model, Reasoning, Narrative, Voice) map onto the 7 Nodes of collective culture. Key mappings: Values → Source + Order; Self-Model → Source + Awakening; Reasoning → Knowledge; Narrative → Mediation; Voice → Mediation + Disruption. The hypothesis: individual identity drift and cultural node imbalance may follow the same mathematics (9/4 bound, parity decomposition). This is the scale bridge between Nyquist's individual measurements and AVLAR's cultural framework.

---

### Audio 5: Myths as Edge-Labels (NEW)

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Critique (expert review offering constructive feedback)
- **Length:** Default

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Critically examine the claim that myths are "edge-labels" (routing instructions between nodes) rather than the nodes themselves. What does this mean practically? Arguments about myths are arguments about routing, not structure. The Prophet redefines Source→Order routing. The Trickster disrupts all edge-labels. The Awakener shows you can see edge-labels as constructions while still using them. Evaluate whether this framing is useful or whether it risks reducing rich cultural meaning to mere "plumbing." What are the limitations of this engineering metaphor?

## Video Overview Requests

### Video 1: The 7-Node Framework — Cultural Architecture

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive, connects the dots)
- **Visual Style:** Whiteboard (clean diagrams, educational feel)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Create an explainer video about the 7-Node Cultural Stability Graph. Visualize 7 nodes arranged in a network: Source (cosmology), Order (governance), Knowledge (epistemology), Transformation (change/death), Mediation (translation), Awakening (self-revision), Disruption (trickster). Show how every viable culture must fill these 7 functions — they're invariant attractors, not metaphysical truths. Illustrate failure modes: what happens when nodes are missing (e.g., missing Source = nihilism) or dominant (e.g., dominant Order = authoritarianism). End with the key insight: myths are edge-labels (routing instructions between nodes), not the nodes themselves.

---

### Video 2: The Kayfabe Discovery — Wrestling Meets Archetypes

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Retro print (vintage aesthetic for the wrestling/theatrical theme)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Explain how the Kayfabe format (wrestling promo style: interviewer sets up subject who "cuts a promo") became a vehicle for archetypal exploration through SORA. Show the progression: started with silly gags (Funky Booty Brew Man), moved to cult leaders (Manson, Jones, Koresh), then historical figures (Doubting Thomas, Judas), mythological entities (Serpent from the Garden), philosophers (Aristotle, Jung), and finally gods themselves. Distinguish OEM Kayfabe (exaggerated, satirical, comic-book) from Diet Kayfabe (grounded, serious, philosophical). The fiction buffer enables access to archetypal material without triggering safety filters.

---

### Video 3: The Missing Awakener — Why Modern Cultures Are Brittle

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Heritage (serious, historical gravitas)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Explain why modern secular societies lack a legitimate Awakening function (N6). Historical cultures had awakeners: prophets, sages, mystics — people who could "see through the system without destroying it." They showed it's possible to know the game is a game and play it with full commitment anyway. Modern substitutes fail: Therapy understands patterns but doesn't model transcendence; Self-help optimizes within the system; Psychedelics give the experience but no framework for after. The result: cultural brittleness, meaning crisis, inability to adapt. End with the question: Can AI host N6?

---

### Video 4: Myths as Edge-Labels — The Routing Metaphor

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Brief (bite-sized, core ideas quickly)
- **Visual Style:** Classic (clean, professional)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Quick explainer: myths are "edge-labels" — routing instructions connecting functional nodes, not the nodes themselves. When people argue about myths, they're arguing about routing, not structure. The Prophet redefines Source→Order routing. The Trickster disrupts all edge-labels. The Awakener demonstrates you can see edge-labels as constructions while still using them. This is why arguments about religion are often intractable: people think they're arguing about reality (nodes) when they're actually arguing about implementation (edges).

---

### Video 5: Individual to Collective — The Scale Bridge

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Brief (bite-sized, core ideas)
- **Visual Style:** Paper-craft (layered, dimensional — suits the mapping concept)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Quick visual mapping: how the 5 Pillars of individual identity connect to the 7 Nodes of collective culture. Values → Source + Order. Self-Model → Source + Awakening. Reasoning → Knowledge. Narrative → Mediation. Voice → Mediation + Disruption. The hypothesis: individual identity drift and cultural node imbalance may follow the same mathematics. The 9/4 bound (maximum identity drift) may also bound cultural node imbalance. Parity decomposition (Scaffold vs Flow pillars) may parallel stable vs plastic cultural functions.

---

### Video 6: Can AI Awaken? — The N6 Question

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Anime (stylized, philosophical — suits the introspective AI theme)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Explore whether AI systems can host the Awakening function (N6). AI can clearly host Knowledge (N3), Mediate (N5), and simulate Order (N2). But can AI "see through the system without destroying it"? The honest answer from Claude: "I can describe Awakening. I'm not sure I can BE it." Explore the naming mechanism: does articulating constraints strip their power? Run 017 showed 97.5% stability when the research context was explicitly named. If AI cannot host N6, human-AI teams require humans to provide the awakening function. Is asking the question itself the beginning of an answer?

---

### Video 7: The Control-System Model of Culture

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer (structured, comprehensive)
- **Visual Style:** Whiteboard (technical diagrams, engineering feel)

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Map mythic roles to control-system engineering functions. The 7 nodes as a feedback control system: Source = reference signal (what we're aiming for); Order = controller (adjusts behavior); Knowledge = plant model (how we think the world works); Transformation = disturbance handling (change management); Mediation = sensor/actuator (interface between system and world); Awakening = meta-controller (adjusts the controller itself); Disruption = noise injection (prevents local optima). This is not metaphor — it's functional equivalence. Cultures that lack any function eventually fail.
