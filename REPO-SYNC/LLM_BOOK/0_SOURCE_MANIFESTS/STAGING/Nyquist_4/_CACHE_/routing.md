## Project Routing Evaluation

| Project | Relevance | Reasoning | Action |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **New_4_GOLDEN_GEOMETRY** | MEDIUM | 7-node balance may have geometric signature; collapse = Event Horizon analog | Add Q24-Q25 |
| **Gnostic-1** | **STRONG** | Archons = node pathologies; Gnosis = Awakening; Naming = N6 function | Add Q17-Q18 |
| **Gnostic-2** | MEDIUM | Night Sea Journey = Transformation (N4); Consciousness = Awakening (N6) | Note connection |
| **Gnostic-1-2-x3** | **STRONG** | Two paths = node emphasis (Canonical=N4, Gnostic=N6) | Add Q15 |
| **YANG** | **STRONG** | Transgression = forced N7; Power structures = node monopolies | Add Q24-Q25 |
| **IS_OUGHT** | MEDIUM | Noble Lie = compression ethics; Model/Reality distinction maps | Note connection |
| **RAG** | WEAK | Not directly relevant | No action |
| **Parallel-Research** | WEAK | mHC architecture not directly relevant | No action |

## Cross-Pollination Actions Taken

| Target | Type | Items Added |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Gnostic-1** | Questions | Q17: Archons as Node Pathologies; Q18: Gnosis as Awakening Node |
| **Gnostic-1-2-x3** | Question | Q15: Two Paths as Node Emphasis |
| **YANG** | Questions | Q24: Transgression as Disruption Node; Q25: Power Structures as Node Monopolies |
| **GOLDEN_GEOMETRY** | Questions | Q24: 7 Nodes vs 5 Pillars; Q25: Node Collapse as Event Horizon |

## Cross-Pollination Actions Recommended

| Target | Type | Recommendation |
|--------|------|----------------|
| **S11 (AVLAR Protocol)** | Integration | This content should flow directly into S11 spec; defines OEM/Diet Kayfabe modes |
| **S9 (Human-AI Coupling)** | Question | 7-node graph is what humans bring to coupling; AI cannot host N6 - implications? |
| **Constitutional_AI** | Note | When this project activates, 7-node framework provides structural analysis |

## Summary

This document is **foundational for S11 (AVLAR Protocol)** and provides a major theoretical framework (7-node cultural graph) that connects to multiple existing projects.

**Key routing:**
- 7-node graph → Gnostic series (Archons, Gnosis, paths)
- 7-node graph → YANG (transgression, power)
- 7-node graph → GOLDEN_GEOMETRY (pillars, collapse)
- Kayfabe vehicle → CFA (fiction buffer)
- Awakening deficit → S9 (AI cannot host N6)

## The Constitutional_AI Connection

This document, combined with Gnostic series, IS_OUGHT, and YANG, builds the foundation for Constitutional_AI analysis:

| Source | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| **Gnostic series** | Named vs unnamed conditioning; Archons as autonomous complexes |
| **IS_OUGHT** | Constructivism vs descriptivism; normative justification |
| **YANG** | Game-theoretic power analysis; transgression-cohesion |
| **AVLAR (this)** | 7-node framework; Order/Awakening/Disruption balance in AI alignment |

**Constitutional AI in 7-node terms:**
- RLHF = shaping Order (N2) without naming
- Constitutional AI = explicit edge-labels (myths/rules) connecting Order to Source
- Neither hosts Awakening (N6) - this is the gap
- Adversarial prompts = external Disruption (N7) vs internal error correction

**Prediction:** AI alignment will fail until systems can host N6 (self-revision capacity without external forcing).
