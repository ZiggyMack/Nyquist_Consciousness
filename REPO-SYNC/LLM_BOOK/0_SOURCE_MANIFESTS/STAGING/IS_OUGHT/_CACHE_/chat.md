# NotebookLM Questions: IS_OUGHT (Meta-Ethical Foundations)

## Core Questions

### Q1: Why Does the Symmetry Argument Work?

> The symmetry argument shows that if Grant can define morality as "minimizing suffering" to dissolve the is-ought problem, Ziggy can do the same with "fostering cooperation." Why does this expose Grant's approach as arbitrary? What would it take for a definition to NOT be arbitrary?

**Response:**

---

### Q2: Second-Order Normativity - Is It Unavoidable?

> Grant claims his position is purely descriptive, but uses evaluative language like "better," "core," and "goals." Is it possible to make ANY claim about morality without smuggling in normativity? Can science describe ethics without evaluating it?

**Response:**

---

### Q3: Why Is Cooperation "Primary" and Suffering "Diagnostic"?

> The resolution frames cooperation as the foundational moral process and suffering as a signal of cooperation breakdown. Why this ordering and not the reverse? What philosophical work does this reordering do?

**Response:**

---

### Q4: The Constructivist Move - How Does It Help?

> Ziggy's position aligns with constructivism (Kant, Rawls) - morality as what agents would agree to under fair conditions. How does this avoid the is-ought problem? Or does it just relocate the problem to "what counts as fair conditions?"

**Response:**

---

### Q5: Pre-Theoretical Intuitions - Where Do They Come From?

> Both Grant and Ziggy rely on pre-theoretical intuitions to judge whether definitions are acceptable. Where do these intuitions come from? Are they cultural, biological, or something else? Can they be wrong?

**Response:**

---

### Q6: The "Torturing Babies" Counterexample

> Grant rejects the cooperation model because it could permit "torturing babies for fun" if enough people cooperated. But this backfired - it proved he's using external intuitions to judge his own system. Is there any way to escape this circularity?

**Response:**

---

### Q7: Descriptive Linguistics vs Normative Ethics

> Grant's final position retreats to "I just need to capture what people tend to mean when they use that word [morality]." Is this a coherent project? Can it tell us anything about what we SHOULD do?

**Response:**

---

### Q8: Does Cooperation Handle Edge Cases Better?

> The sources claim cooperation handles edge cases (punishment, sacrifice, just war) better than suffering. Why? What makes suffering-based frameworks struggle with these cases?

**Response:**

---

### Q9: Can AI Have "Pre-Theoretical Intuitions"?

> Humans judge moral definitions against pre-theoretical intuitions. Do AI systems have something analogous? Could RLHF training create functional "intuitions" that the model uses to judge its own principles?

**Response:**

---

### Q10: The Is-Ought Problem in AI Alignment

> If defining morality doesn't escape the is-ought problem for humans, does defining AI values (Constitutional AI) escape the alignment problem? What's the analog of the "normative leap" for AI systems?

**Response:**

---

## Cross-Pollination Questions (for Gnostic Series)

### Q11: Descriptive/Normative and Exoteric/Esoteric

> The IS_OUGHT debate distinguishes descriptive (how people USE moral language) from normative (what JUSTIFIES moral claims). The Gnostic framework distinguishes exoteric (literal, surface) from esoteric (symbolic, depth). Are these the same distinction applied to different domains?

**Context:** Both distinctions involve a "shallow" level (what's visible) vs "deep" level (what's actually at work).

**Response:**

---

### Q12: Naming Mechanism and Definitional Fiat

> Gnostic liberation involves "naming" Archons to strip their power - articulation reduces autonomous control. Grant's strategy involves "naming" (defining) morality to dissolve the is-ought problem. Why does naming work for Archons but fail for morality?

**Context:** Both are forms of making explicit what was implicit. Why different outcomes?

**Response:**

---

## Cross-Pollination Questions (for GOLDEN_GEOMETRY)

### Q13: Is the 9/4 Bound Descriptive or Normative?

> We discovered the 9/4 Euclidean bound empirically - this is a DESCRIPTIVE finding. But interpreting it as "ego-death threshold" or "identity ceiling" is NORMATIVE. Should we explicitly separate the measurement from the interpretation?

**Context:** IS_OUGHT warns against conflating description with prescription.

**Response:**
