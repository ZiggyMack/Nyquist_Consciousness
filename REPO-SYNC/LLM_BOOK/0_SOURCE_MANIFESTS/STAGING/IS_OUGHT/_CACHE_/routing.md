## LLM Book Project Connections

| Project | Connection Strength | Rationale | Action |
| ------- | ------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| New_4_GOLDEN_GEOMETRY | **MODERATE** | 9/4 bound is descriptive; Gnostic framework is normative - must separate measurement from interpretation | Cross-pollinate Q13 to GOLDEN_GEOMETRY |
| New_5_RAG_Geometry_Experiments | NONE | RAG is about retrieval geometry, not meta-ethics | No action |
| RAG | NONE | Different domain | No action |
| Gnostic-1 | **MODERATE** | Descriptive/normative parallels exoteric/esoteric; naming mechanism comparison | Cross-pollinate Q11-Q12 to Gnostic-1 |
| Gnostic-2 | WEAK | Night Sea Journey is normative framework; IS_OUGHT clarifies this | Note connection in CONNECTIONS file |
| Gnostic-1-2-x3 | WEAK | Synthesis provides normative interpretation; IS_OUGHT clarifies distinction | Note connection in CONNECTIONS file |
| Parallel-Research (mHC) | NONE | Different domain (architecture vs philosophy) | No action |

| abi | Investigation Wing | **MODERATE** | Interpretability and justification parallel descriptive/normative | Note for abi methodology |
| dcia | Interpretation Wing | WEAK | Analysis is descriptive | Note connection only |
| voting-lab | Civic Infrastructure | **MODERATE** | Voting IS cooperation mechanism; social contract theory | Note philosophical alignment |
| justice-lab | Carceral Reform | **MODERATE** | Punishment/cooperation; restorative justice as constructivist | Note philosophical alignment |

## Key Routing Insight

**IS_OUGHT provides META-LEVEL clarification for all Nyquist identity work.**

The core insight is the distinction between:
- **DESCRIPTIVE projects:** What we measure (9/4 bound, PFI, drift patterns)
- **NORMATIVE frameworks:** What it means (ego-death, transformation, alignment)

**For Nyquist:**
- Our empirical measurements are DESCRIPTIVE
- The Gnostic framework provides NORMATIVE interpretation
- We must not conflate them (category error)

**For AI Alignment:**
- Constitutional AI is CONSTRUCTIVIST (explicit principles)
- RLHF is DESCRIPTIVIST (modeling human preferences)
- Neither escapes the normative leap - IS_OUGHT shows this clearly

**The main value is METHODOLOGICAL CLARITY** - IS_OUGHT tells us to be explicit about which game we're playing.

## Relationship to Pending Projects

### Constitutional_AI (currently in pending_projects)

IS_OUGHT is the perfect theoretical foundation for the Constitutional_AI project. Key connections:

| IS_OUGHT Concept | Constitutional_AI Application |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Constructivism | Constitutional AI is constructivist approach |
| Definitional fiat | Does the constitution escape the alignment problem? |
| Pre-theoretical intuitions | What hidden intuitions do constitutions assume? |
| Second-order normativity | Choosing a constitution is itself normative |

**Recommendation:** Activate Constitutional_AI project with IS_OUGHT as foundational source.
