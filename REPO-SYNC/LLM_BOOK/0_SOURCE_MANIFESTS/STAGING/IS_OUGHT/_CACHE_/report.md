## Infographics

### Infographic 1: The Is-Ought Gap

**Visual Concept:** Bridge diagram showing gap between "IS" (facts) and "OUGHT" (values).

**Elements:**
- Left cliff: "Facts" (suffering exists, cooperation works, etc.)
- Right cliff: "Values" (we ought to reduce suffering, we ought to cooperate)
- Gap in middle: "The Is-Ought Gap"
- Failed bridges: "Definition" (collapses), "Science" (doesn't reach)
- Successful bridge: "Normative Commitment" (requires leap)

---

### Infographic 2: Descriptive vs Normative Projects

**Visual Concept:** Two parallel tracks showing different destinations.

**Elements:**
- Track 1: "Descriptive Ethics" -> "How do people use moral language?" -> "Moral Semantics"
- Track 2: "Normative Ethics" -> "What justifies moral claims?" -> "Ethical Theory"
- Red X: Crossing from Track 1 to Track 2's destination
- Quote: "You can't win an ethics argument with a dictionary"

---

### Infographic 3: Cooperation Primary, Suffering Diagnostic

**Visual Concept:** Flow diagram showing causal chain.

**Elements:**
- Primary Level: "COOPERATION" (foundation)
- Disruption: "Suffering occurs"
- Signal: "Signals cooperation breakdown"
- Interpretation: "Which is why we care morally"
- Quote: "Suffering is just a metric used to calibrate the level of cooperation"

---

### Infographic 4: The Symmetry Argument

**Visual Concept:** Mirror image showing Grant and Ziggy's parallel moves.

**Elements:**
- Left: Grant defines morality as suffering -> "Ought to minimize suffering" (tautology)
- Right: Ziggy defines morality as cooperation -> "Ought to foster cooperation" (tautology)
- Center: "Both require external intuitions to judge which is correct"
- Bottom: "Definition doesn't escape the normative leap - it hides it"
