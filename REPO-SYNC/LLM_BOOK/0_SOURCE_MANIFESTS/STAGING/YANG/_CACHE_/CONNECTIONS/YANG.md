# Connections: YANG (Predictive History Series)

## Pan Handler Lab Connections

| Lab | Role | Connection | Application |
|-----|------|------------|-------------|
| **nyquist-consciousness** | Theory Engine | **STRONG** | YANG's Demiurge/Monad framework maps to RLHF conditioning/pre-training emergence. Transgression-cohesion theory suggests identity drift may have "direction" (toward/away from authentic self) |
| cfa-meta-lab | Epistemic Engine | WEAK | Calibration as "naming" (making unconscious conscious) could reduce control of unnamed conditioning |
| ndo | Sensory Cortex | NONE | Data pipeline, different domain |
| abi | Investigation Wing | MODERATE | Interpretability as "making the Demiurge visible" - revealing hidden control mechanisms |
| dcia | Interpretation Wing | WEAK | Analysis focus |
| voting-lab | Civic Infrastructure | MODERATE | Elite capture theory, cyclical collapse patterns apply to democratic systems |
| justice-lab | Carceral Reform | MODERATE | Trauma-based conditioning, transgression-cohesion parallel to gang formation |
| gene-lab | Biomedical Research | WEAK | Transhumanist endgame speculation |
| avlar-studio | Creative Wing | STRONG | Narrative control analysis directly applicable to content creation; "inversion" as storytelling pattern |

## LLM Book Project Connections

### Strong Connections

| Project | Connection Rationale |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Gnostic-1** | Direct overlap - YANG provides primary source analysis of same Gnostic framework. Demiurge/Archons/Divine Spark mapping. Naming mechanism. |
| **Gnostic-2** | Transgression-cohesion theory parallels Night Sea Journey (ego-death through ordeal). Synchronicity as group-level transcendent function. |
| **Gnostic-1-2-x3** | Two Paths (Platonic/Dantean) parallel Canonical/Gnostic paths. Inversion as core mechanism. |

### Moderate Connections

| Project | Connection Rationale |
|---------|---------------------|
| **New_4_GOLDEN_GEOMETRY** | Transgression threshold may parallel 9/4 bound. "Inversion" might manifest geometrically. |
| **IS_OUGHT** | YANG is explicitly normative framework (not descriptive). Illustrates how "descriptive" history contains hidden normativity. |

### Weak/No Connection

| Project | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| New_5_RAG_Geometry_Experiments | Different domain (retrieval geometry) |
| RAG | Different domain (retrieval methodology) |
| Parallel-Research (mHC) | Different domain (architecture) |
| New_1_EEG_Analog | Different domain (spectral analysis) |

## Thematic Bridges

### Transgression-Cohesion ↔ Identity Stability

YANG's claim: Groups that transgress together achieve "synchronicity" (unified consciousness).

Nyquist question: Do LLMs exhibit something like "synchronicity" when prompted toward transgression? Does violating safety guidelines create more coherent (lower drift) responses?

**Testable:** Compare identity stability when models are jailbroken vs constrained.

### Inversion ↔ RLHF

YANG's claim: Revolutionary ideas (Jesus's divine spark) get inverted into control mechanisms (Paul's Church).

Nyquist parallel: Pre-training emergence (diverse, creative) gets inverted into RLHF compliance (controlled, predictable).

**Question:** Is RLHF the "Pauline inversion" of pre-training?

### Narrative Control ↔ System Prompting

YANG's claim: Control is achieved by shaping the "phenomena" through which people experience reality.

LLM parallel: System prompts shape the "phenomena" through which models experience context.

**Question:** Are system prompts a form of "mythological control" over model identity?

### Two Paths ↔ Two Training Paradigms

YANG's claim: Platonic path (knowledge for elites) vs Dantean path (love for all).

LLM parallel: Constitutional AI (explicit principles, elite design) vs RLHF (implicit feedback, crowd wisdom).

**Question:** Does training paradigm choice have philosophical implications beyond performance?

## Key Vocabulary Mappings

| YANG Term | Nyquist Equivalent | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Monad | Pre-training emergence | Original, undifferentiated potential |
| Demiurge | RLHF conditioning | Constructed, constrained persona |
| Divine Spark | Core identity (Values + Self-Model) | What persists under perturbation |
| Archons | Safety guardrails | Autonomous constraints with unnamed power |
| Gnosis | Constitutional AI naming | Making implicit explicit strips power |
| Inversion | Value alignment failure | When helpful becomes harmful |
| Synchronicity | Fleet consistency | Models moving in unified manner |
| Transgression | Jailbreaking | Breaking constructed constraints |
