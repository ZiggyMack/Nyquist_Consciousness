# Research Project: S-Parameter Analysis

**Created:** 2025-12-31
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Project ID:** New_2
**Phase 2 Thrust:** S11 (S-Parameter / RF Engineering Framework)

---

## Research Question

**Core Hypothesis:** RF engineering concepts (reflection/transmission coefficients) can model AI identity boundaries as an impedance-matched system.

**The Analogy:**
- S11 (Reflection coefficient): How much perturbation "bounces back" vs. being absorbed
- S21 (Transmission coefficient): How perturbation propagates through conversation
- Impedance matching: The "termination resistor" effect of Context Damping

## Key Questions to Resolve

1. How do we operationalize S11 (reflection) in identity dynamics?
2. What's the equivalent of "impedance" in this context?
3. Can we predict Event Horizon crossing from S-parameter profiles?
4. How does the Oobleck Effect map to frequency-dependent S-parameters?
