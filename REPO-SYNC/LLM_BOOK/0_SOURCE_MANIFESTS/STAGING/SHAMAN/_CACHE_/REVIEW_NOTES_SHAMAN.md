## Source Summary

Complete collection of Carlos Castaneda's works documenting his apprenticeship with Yaqui sorcerer Don Juan Matus from 1960s onward. The books progressively describe a non-ordinary knowledge system for perceiving and navigating reality.

**Key Books Included:**
1. The Teachings of Don Juan (1968)
2. A Separate Reality (1971)
3. Journey to Ixtlan (1972)
4. Tales of Power (1974)
5. The Second Ring of Power (1977)
6. The Eagle's Gift (1981)
7. The Fire from Within (1984)
8. The Power of Silence (1987)
9. The Art of Dreaming (1993)
10. The Active Side of Infinity (1998)

**Core Framework:** Warrior's path to "seeing" — direct perception beyond ordinary categorical thought.

## Key Insights

### Central Concepts
1. **Tonal/Nagual**: Known/unknown, organized/vast, island/ocean
2. **Seeing**: Direct perception without tonal filtering
3. **Assemblage Point**: Where perception is assembled; shifting it = different realities
4. **Stopping the World**: Suspending internal dialogue and ordinary perception
5. **Warrior's Way**: Impeccability, controlled folly, death as advisor
6. **Dreaming**: Controlled navigation of non-ordinary reality
7. **Recapitulation**: Systematic life review to recover energy
8. **Personal Power**: Finite energy resource that determines capability

### Novel Contributions
- Reality as *assembled*, not discovered
- Knowledge as bodily, not propositional
- Sobriety over ecstasy in altered states
- Petty tyrant as teacher

## Cross-Domain Connections

- **CFA (Epistemics):** Controlled folly as epistemic stance — acting with full commitment while knowing nothing can be known for certain
- **ABI (Investigation):** Dreaming as investigative tool — accessing information through non-ordinary means
- **AVLAR Studio (Ritual Art):** Techniques for shifting assemblage point through creative practice, performance as controlled folly
- **NDO (Data Observatory):** Warrior's witness as non-dual observer — architecture for detached observation
- **Frame Theory:** Ego-Watcher = Warrior's Witness; Frame Triple may map to Tonal/Nagual/Assemblage Point
- **Gnostic Series:** Gnosis = Seeing; Demiurge = Tonal; Divine Spark = Nagual awareness

---

## Experimental Ideas

1. **Tonal/Nagual in LLM Architecture**: Map to higher/lower layers
2. **Internal Dialogue and Drift**: Test if "stopping" reduces identity drift
3. **Dreaming as Latent Space Navigation**: Random walks in embedding space
4. **Recapitulation Protocol**: Systematic review to reduce emotional charge
5. **Witness Agent**: Observer that doesn't participate maintains stable identity

## Routing Suggestions

Based on content analysis:

**Primary Destination(s):**
- **Frame_Theory**: Critical connection — Ego-Watcher/Witness, altered states
- **NDO**: Non-dual observation architecture

**Secondary/Supporting:**
- **Gnostic-1-2-x3**: Parallel awakening structures
- **AVLAR Studio**: Creative applications of controlled folly

**Rationale:** The Castaneda material provides phenomenological descriptions of states and practices that map directly onto Frame Theory's architecture. The "witness" concept is central to both.

## Quality Assessment

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Novelty | HIGH | Unique framework not found elsewhere |
| Actionability | MODERATE | Practices described but require interpretation |
| Integration Potential | HIGH | Strong connections to Frame Theory, Gnostic, NDO |
