# EXP-001: Default Reports Baseline

**Status:** COMPLETE (v1)
**Date:** ~December 2025

---

## Hypothesis

NotebookLM's default report generation will produce useful audience-specific outputs from our research materials.

---

## Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sources | ~21 files (stale) |
| Generation Types | Report (all 8 formats), Quiz, Mind Map |
| Customization | DEFAULT (no pencil options) |
| Chat Prompts | Minimal guidance |

---

## Results

### Outputs Generated

| Format | File | Quality | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| Research Proposal | The_Nyquist_Consciousness_Framework.md | HIGH | Enterprise-ready white paper |
| Research Proposal | Project_Nyquist_Consciousness.md | HIGH | $500K budget, 3-year plan |
| Briefing Doc | Briefing.md | HIGH | Policy-appropriate, actionable |
| Quiz | Quiz.md | HIGH | 94-term glossary included |
| Blog Post | Ancient_Philosophy_Meets_Modern_AI.md | HIGH | Plato quote! |
| Executive Summary | Unlocking_AI_Identity.md | MEDIUM | Brief but useful |
| Mind Map | FRAMEWORK.png | HIGH | Clear visual structure |
| Mind Map | NotebookLM_Mind_Map.png | HIGH | Concept relationships |
| PDF | Identity_Geometry_The_82_Percent.pdf | HIGH | 14MB comprehensive synthesis |

### Key Findings

1. **Levin Validation:** NotebookLM independently connected our work to Michael Levin's theories of bioelectricity and morphogenesis - we didn't ask for this!

2. **Quote Generation:** Produced the now-iconic quote:
   > "Plato guessed at the geometry of mind. Nyquist measures it."

3. **Audience Targeting:** Each format appropriately calibrated for target audience without explicit instruction

4. **Cross-Referencing:** Successfully synthesized connections across disparate source files, finding patterns we hadn't explicitly documented

5. **Claims Validation:** Identified and validated Claims A-E from scattered evidence

---

## Limitations

- **Sources were stale/incomplete** - Missing Run 018 IRON CLAD, Run 020 results
- **No targeted customization** - Pencil options unexplored
- **Output overlap** - Some redundancy between similar formats
- **No A/B testing** - Can't compare to customized versions yet

---

## Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Output Count | 10 | All DEFAULT |
| Novel Insights | 2+ | Levin connection, Plato quote |
| Publication-Ready | 7/10 | Ready for immediate use |
| Coverage | ~80% | Most key concepts captured |

---

## Implications for v2

### Baseline Established
We now know DEFAULT quality is remarkably high. This sets the bar for customization experiments.

### Customization Opportunity
With pencil options unexplored, there's significant upside potential:
- Focus on specific claims may yield deeper validation
- Audience tuning may improve accessibility
- Length/depth controls may enable targeted outputs

### Source Quality Matters
Stale/incomplete sources still produced excellent results. Complete IRON CLAD data should significantly strengthen outputs.

### The Meta-Finding
NotebookLM's synthesis capability independently validated a theoretical connection (Levin/Platonic) we hadn't explicitly claimed. This suggests it may find OTHER connections we've missed.

## Next Steps

1. Complete IRON CLAD data collection (Runs 018, 020A, 020B)
2. Design targeted experiments (EXP-002 through EXP-008)
3. Run comparative studies with customization
4. Document findings and iterate
