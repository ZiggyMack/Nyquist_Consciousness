Position Paper: The Primacy of Cooperation Over Suffering as a Normative Foundation for Morality

1.0 Introduction: Locating a Non-Arbitrary Moral Foundation

The perennial philosophical search for a non-arbitrary basis for morality is a quest to secure ethical principles against the charges of mere preference, cultural convention, or subjective whim. Without a stable foundation, moral claims risk becoming expressions of power or emotion rather than reasoned judgments. This paper enters into this search by analyzing two competing frameworks: a suffering-based model, which purports to offer a scientific and empirical basis for ethics by grounding it in the minimization of suffering, and a cooperation-based model, which locates morality in the principles that enable and sustain fair social cooperation. The strategic importance of choosing the correct foundational principle cannot be overstated, as it determines not only the content of our moral duties but the very structure of moral justification itself.

This paper argues that a cooperation-based framework is normatively superior because the suffering-based model commits a fundamental category error, mistaking the descriptive project of moral semantics for the prescriptive demands of normative ethics. In doing so, it offers a tautology where a justification is required, whereas the cooperation-based model provides a structural account of justification itself.

To substantiate this thesis, this paper will proceed in four stages. First, it will deconstruct the suffering-based model, exposing the semantic sleight of hand it uses to appear normative. Second, it will employ a symmetrical challenge to demonstrate the inherent arbitrariness of any definitional attempt to bypass the is-ought gap. Third, it will provide a direct comparative analysis of the practical and theoretical strengths of the two frameworks. Finally, it will present the positive case for cooperation as the primary normative ground, re-contextualizing suffering as a critical but subordinate moral signal. We begin with a critical examination of the suffering-based model and its core claims.

2.0 The Suffering-Based Model: A Descriptive Project Masquerading as Normative Ethics

The appeal of a suffering-based morality is undeniable. It promises to move ethics out of the realm of abstract speculation and onto firm, empirical ground. By framing its claims as “descriptive or empirical” and therefore “testable,” proponents attempt to reduce ethics to a scientific or predictive model of language use. By focusing on the tangible reality of suffering, they claim to offer a foundation for morality that is both universal and scientifically verifiable. However, a critical analysis of this model reveals that its claim to normative validity rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the task of ethical theory.

The central argument of the suffering-based model, as articulated by its proponents, is not a normative claim but a descriptive one. The argument is that when people use moral language—words like "ought," "should," or "wrong"—they are, in fact, referring to the goal of minimizing suffering. This reframes the ethical project as a descriptive one: a kind of moral semantics or psychology focused on capturing what people mean by "morality."

This approach attempts to address the classic is-ought problem through a semantic sleight of hand. By defining morality as "minimizing suffering," the statement "one ought to minimize suffering" becomes a tautology—true by definition, like saying "a bachelor is an unmarried man." But this move is a diversion, not a solution. As the source material notes:

But that’s semantic sleight of hand—they’re changing the definition, not justifying the imperative.

Just because suffering is unpleasant or we can predict that people will call it bad does not entail that we ought to eliminate it. By redefining the term, the model avoids having to provide a justification for the moral imperative itself. It sidesteps the normative leap rather than successfully making it.

This exposes the model's fundamental category error. It confuses what are, in effect, different games with different rules: descriptive moral semantics and normative ethics. The former is a linguistic or psychological project concerned with how people use moral language. The latter is a philosophical project concerned with what makes a moral claim justified. By focusing exclusively on describing language use, the suffering-based model fails to engage with the core ethical question: what provides the authority for a moral claim? It tells us what people might mean by "moral," but it cannot tell us why we should be moral in the first place. This definitional approach is not only philosophically unsatisfying; its arbitrariness can be exposed through a simple symmetrical challenge.

3.0 Exposing Arbitrariness Through a Symmetrical Challenge

The strategic purpose of this section is to demonstrate that any attempt to solve the is-ought problem by definitional fiat is inherently arbitrary. By constructing a parallel case using a cooperation-based definition, we can reveal that the suffering model's apparent success relies not on its definition but on unacknowledged, pre-theoretical moral intuitions smuggled into the argument.

The symmetry argument is straightforward. If one can claim that the is-ought problem is resolved by defining morality as "minimizing suffering," then one can perform the exact same logical move with a different definition:

"Morality just means fostering cooperation. Moral acts are those that promote social harmony, coordination, and collective survival."

Both definitions make the corresponding "ought" statement tautological within their own systems. The proponent of the suffering-based model attempts to rebut this parallel by introducing a counterexample: "torturing babies for fun." They argue that people would recognize this act as immoral, regardless of how many people are cooperating in the effort, thus proving that cooperation cannot be the foundation of morality.

This rebuttal, however, spectacularly backfires, proving the exact opposite of its intention. By rejecting the cooperation-based definition because it leads to a "bad moral conclusion," the opponent reveals their reliance on pre-existing, pre-theoretical moral judgments. This move reveals that the opponent's descriptive model is parasitic on a normative intuition that his own framework cannot account for or justify. The real work is not being done by the proposed definition but by an independent, unstated moral intuition that "torturing babies is wrong." This intuition is used to judge whether the definition is acceptable in the first place. The same applies to their own suffering-based model; it is accepted because it aligns with our pre-existing intuition that suffering is bad, not because the definition itself provides any independent justification.

This analysis exposes the circularity at the heart of all such definitional models. The key takeaways can be summarized as follows:

* Its central imperative is tautological, not justified, as it merely restates a definition.
* Its justificatory standard smuggles in an independent ought, relying on pre-theoretical intuitions to select the "correct" definition.
* Its ultimate arbiter consists of deeper, unaccounted-for norms, which are invoked to reject definitions that produce unacceptable conclusions.

Therefore, defining morality to escape the is-ought gap is a philosophical dead end that only hides the normative leap. Having exposed this logical flaw, we can now proceed to a direct comparison of the two frameworks on their practical and theoretical merits.

4.0 A Comparative Analysis of Normative Frameworks

Beyond the logical flaws inherent in definitional ethics, the cooperation-based and suffering-based models also differ significantly in their practical and theoretical strengths as organizing principles for a moral system. This section evaluates their core features to determine which provides a more stable, objective, and comprehensive foundation for normative ethics. The following table outlines a direct comparison based on key attributes identified in the source material.

Feature	Fostering Cooperation	Minimizing Suffering
Empirical grounding	Strong in evolutionary biology and anthropology	Strong in neuroscience and affective psychology
Group-focus	Emphasizes shared survival, social cohesion	Focuses more on individual well-being
Less subjective	Cooperation can be modeled and observed as behavior	Suffering is internal and sometimes hard to compare
Stable	Allows some suffering if it benefits the group (e.g., military service)	Suffers from edge cases where doing "harm" can reduce more suffering

This comparison highlights several key differentiators. The cooperation framework is grounded in observable, group-oriented behaviors studied in fields like evolutionary biology and anthropology. Its focus is on social cohesion and shared survival, making its core concepts—reciprocity, fairness, mutual agreement—amenable to external observation and modeling. In contrast, the suffering framework is grounded in the internal, affective states of individuals, as studied by neuroscience and psychology. While empirically real, these states are inherently subjective and difficult to compare between individuals.

This distinction is critical. A cooperation-based framework aligns with "measurable group outcomes," providing a more objective basis for resolving moral disputes. A suffering-based framework, however, is "highly subjective and easily weaponized," as competing claims about internal states can be difficult to adjudicate. Furthermore, the cooperation model provides a more stable account of complex moral judgments, such as the justification for punishment, sacrifice, or just war, where inflicting some suffering is deemed morally necessary for the sake of a greater cooperative good. The suffering model struggles with these edge cases, often collapsing into simplistic calculations that fail to capture our considered moral judgments. This comparison reveals that cooperation provides a more objective, stable, and publicly accessible foundation for morality, setting the stage for this paper's primary constructive argument: that cooperation is not merely a better framework, but the normative ground from which other moral considerations, including suffering, derive their meaning.

5.0 The Normative Primacy of Cooperation: Re-contextualizing Suffering as a Moral Signal

This paper's core constructive argument is that the most coherent moral framework positions cooperation as the foundational normative process and reframes suffering as a critical, but subordinate, diagnostic tool. This resolves the apparent "chicken-egg" problem of which comes first by demonstrating that suffering derives its moral significance from its relationship to the demands of cooperation.

The logical progression of this framework provides a clear resolution to the dilemma:

Suffering disrupts cooperation → which signals a violation of mutual respect → which is why we care about it morally.

In this view, suffering is not a brute, standalone moral truth that exists independent of a relational context. Instead, it derives its moral salience from its consequences for cooperative engagement. An act that causes suffering becomes morally relevant precisely because it signals that someone is not being treated as a full participant in a system of mutual respect and justification. Cooperation is the "first principle" because it inherently carries normative structure—it presupposes shared reasoning, fairness, and the moral standing of participants. Suffering, on its own, is merely an experiential state. Only within the shared context of cooperation does it become a morally significant signal that the terms of that cooperation have been violated. As the source material concisely puts it:

"Suffering is just a metric used to calibrate the level of cooperation."

This cooperation-first framework aligns with a constructivist approach to ethics, echoing the procedural traditions of philosophers like Kant and Rawls. From this perspective, morality is not about discovering a pre-existing metaphysical truth, such as "suffering is intrinsically bad." Instead, the entire project is oriented toward a different question. It is about discovering "what agents can justifiably demand of each other." Cooperation is the moral process itself, not merely a means to an end. It is a "dynamic, negotiated standard" rooted in the shared moral standing of rational agents seeking to establish fair terms of interaction. This approach avoids the is-ought problem not by definitional fiat, but by locating normativity in the intersubjective process of justification that cooperation requires.

6.0 Conclusion: From Definitional Fiat to Relational Engagement

This paper has argued against a suffering-based model of morality by exposing its fundamental flaws. We have shown that this model commits a category error, mistaking the descriptive project of moral semantics for the prescriptive project of normative ethics. Its attempt to bypass the is-ought problem relies on a tautological definition that merely hides the normative leap without justifying it. Ultimately, its appeal depends on unacknowledged, pre-theoretical moral intuitions, revealing its own structural circularity when placed under scrutiny.

In its place, this paper has asserted the normative primacy of a cooperation-based model. This framework provides a more robust and defensible foundation for morality by locating its source not in a subjective internal state, but in the intersubjective process of relational engagement and mutual justification. By positioning cooperation as the primary normative process and suffering as a key indicator of its breakdown, this model offers a coherent structure for understanding moral obligation that is both theoretically sound and practically applicable.

This shift in perspective has profound implications. It moves ethics away from a project of identifying brute empirical facts or defining terms and toward a "mature and defensible" project of understanding, negotiating, and upholding the terms of just cooperation. Morality, in this view, is not something we discover in the world like a scientific law, but something we construct together through the reasoned and respectful relational engagement that defines just cooperation.
