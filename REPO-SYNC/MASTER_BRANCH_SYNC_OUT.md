# Master Branch Sync-Out

**Purpose:** Staging area for content to sync FROM the main REPO TO anyone external.

**Last Cleared:** 2025-12-30

---

## Instructions

1. Place content below that should be synced to main branch
2. Content types typically synced OUT:
   - Experiment results → main branch experiments/
   - Validated methodology → main branch docs/
   - Publication materials → main branch WHITE-PAPER/
   - Dashboard updates → main branch dashboard/
3. Once synced, this file gets cleared

---

## Pending Content: Dashboard/Publication Page Update Prompt

**For:** Another Claude instance to update the dashboard publication page

---

## Prompt for Dashboard/Publication Page Updates

---

**TASK:** Update the Nyquist Consciousness dashboard publication page with current IRON CLAD statistics and reviewer package status.

---

### WHERE TO FIND EVERYTHING

**1. Source of Truth for Current Statistics:**
```
WHITE-PAPER/reviewers/packages/CURRENT_VERSION.json
```

This file contains:
- Current version (v4)
- All methodology values (Event Horizon, inherent drift, p-value, etc.)
- Audit summary showing what was updated

**Key values from CURRENT_VERSION.json:**
```json
{
  "methodology": {
    "event_horizon": 0.80,
    "inherent_drift": "~93%",
    "inherent_source": "Run 020B IRON CLAD (0.661/0.711)",

    └── ... (9 PDFs total, ~30 MB)
```

**5. Calibration Scripts (Pipeline):**
```
WHITE-PAPER/calibration/README.md
```

Documents the workflow: `0_sync_viz.py → 1_sync_llmbook.py → 3_generate_pdfs.py → 2_package_review.py → 4_publish_stats.py`

**6. Dashboard Statistics Output:**
```
WHITE-PAPER/calibration/publication_stats.json
```

Generated by `4_publish_stats.py` - contains extracted stats for dashboard integration.

### THE 5 CORE CLAIMS (ALL VALIDATED)

| Claim | Statement | Key Metric | Status |
|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
| **A** | PFI is valid structured measurement | ρ = 0.91, d = 0.698 | VALIDATED |
| **B** | Regime threshold exists | D = 0.80 (cosine), p = 2.40e-23 | VALIDATED |
| **C** | Damped oscillator dynamics | τₛ ≈ 7 probes | VALIDATED |
| **D** | Context damping works | 97.5% stability | VALIDATED |
| **E** | Drift is mostly inherent | ~93% (Run 020B IRON CLAD) | VALIDATED |

### KEY STATISTICS TO DISPLAY

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Event Horizon** | D = 0.80 (cosine) | Run 023b calibration |
| **Inherent Drift** | ~93% | Run 020B IRON CLAD (0.661/0.711) |
| **Cohen's d** | 0.698 | Run 023d model-level |
| **p-value** | 2.40e-23 | Run 023d perturbation |

### DASHBOARD ENTRY POINTS

**To read current stats programmatically:**
```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

# Load current version info
with open("WHITE-PAPER/reviewers/packages/CURRENT_VERSION.json") as f:
    version_info = json.load(f)

# Load publication stats (if generated)
with open("WHITE-PAPER/calibration/publication_stats.json") as f:
    pub_stats = json.load(f)

# Display key metrics
methodology = version_info["methodology"]
print(f"Event Horizon: D = {methodology['event_horizon']}")
print(f"Inherent Drift: {methodology['inherent_drift']}")
print(f"Experiments: {methodology['experiments']}")
```

**Dashboard location (if updating Streamlit app):**
```
dashboard/
```

---

### SUGGESTED DASHBOARD UPDATES

1. **Update all "82%" references to "~93%"**
2. **Update experiment counts: 825 → 750, 51 models → 25 models**
3. **Update settling time: τₛ 10.2 → τₛ ≈ 7**
4. **Add Run 020B IRON CLAD as source for inherent drift**
5. **Ensure 5 providers (not 6): Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Together**
6. **Link to PDF downloads in `reviewers/packages/pdf/`**

---

### IRON CLAD METHODOLOGY REFERENCE

**Always use these exact values:**
- Event Horizon = **0.80** (cosine distance, NOT 1.23 which was Keyword RMS)
- p-value = **2.40e-23**
- Inherent drift = **~93%** (from Run 020B: 0.661/0.711)
- Cohen's d = **0.698** (model-level aggregates)
- Settling time = **τₛ ≈ 7 probes**
- PCs for 90% variance = **2**

---

*IRON CLAD Methodology: Event Horizon = 0.80 (cosine), p = 2.40e-23, ~93% Inherent Drift*
*Run 023d: 750 experiments, 25 models, 5 providers*
*Run 020B: 248 sessions, 37 IRON CLAD ships, source of ~93% finding*
