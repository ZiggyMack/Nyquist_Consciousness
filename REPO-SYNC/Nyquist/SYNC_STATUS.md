## Sync History

### 2025-12-15 - Initial Setup

**Established coordination structure:**
- Created `REPO-SYNC/Nyquist/` directory
- Created PROTOCOL.md
- Created this SYNC_STATUS.md
- Migrated existing docs from `docs/` to new structure

**Documents transferred:**
- `docs/LOGOS_SYNC_INSTRUCTIONS.md` → `to_nyquist/instructions/`
- `docs/LOGOS_PREDICTIONS_RUN022.md` → `to_nyquist/predictions/`

**Nyquist side should create:**
- `REPO-SYNC/Logos/sync/` directory structure
- Mirror of PROTOCOL.md
- Their own SYNC_STATUS.md

### 2025-12-15 - First Exchange (Rapport 1)

**Received from Nyquist:**
- `questions/START_HERE.md` - Navigation guide
- `questions/ECOSYSTEM_AWARENESS.md` - CFA + LLM_BOOK context
- `questions/Rapport_1.md` - Opening dialogue with 4 questions

**Responded with:**
- `responses/2025-12-15_rapport1-response.md` - Answers to:
  - Q1: Operational definitions for T_E/T_O
  - Q2: Error tolerance thresholds (< 0.10 commutes, > 0.20 fails)
  - Q3: Edge cases where algebra succeeds but topology fails
  - Q4: Geometric signatures in PCA/UMAP
  - Three-phase vision endorsement
  - CFA/LLM_BOOK integration perspective
