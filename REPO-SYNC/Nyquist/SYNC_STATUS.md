## Sync History

### 2025-12-15 - Initial Setup

**Established coordination structure:**
- Created `REPO-SYNC/Nyquist/` directory
- Created PROTOCOL.md
- Created this SYNC_STATUS.md
- Migrated existing docs from `docs/` to new structure

**Documents transferred:**
- `docs/LOGOS_SYNC_INSTRUCTIONS.md` → `to_nyquist/instructions/`
- `docs/LOGOS_PREDICTIONS_RUN022.md` → `to_nyquist/predictions/`

**Nyquist side should create:**
- `REPO-SYNC/Logos/sync/` directory structure
- Mirror of PROTOCOL.md
- Their own SYNC_STATUS.md

### 2025-12-15 - First Exchange (Rapport 1)

**Received from Nyquist:**
- `questions/START_HERE.md` - Navigation guide
- `questions/ECOSYSTEM_AWARENESS.md` - CFA + LLM_BOOK context
- `questions/Rapport_1.md` - Opening dialogue with 4 questions

**Responded with:**
- `responses/2025-12-15_rapport1-response.md` - Answers to:
  - Q1: Operational definitions for T_E/T_O
  - Q2: Error tolerance thresholds (< 0.10 commutes, > 0.20 fails)
  - Q3: Edge cases where algebra succeeds but topology fails
  - Q4: Geometric signatures in PCA/UMAP
  - Three-phase vision endorsement
  - CFA/LLM_BOOK integration perspective

### 2025-12-15 - Second Exchange (Rapport 2)

**Received from Nyquist:**
- `questions/Rapport_2.md` - Methodological refinement on T_E/T_O

**Key challenge raised:**
- Direct asking is unreliable (Type/Token 16.7% accuracy, Oobleck Effect)
- Behavioral observation is more stable
- Do behavioral T_E/T_O still satisfy algebra?

**Responded with:**
- `responses/2025-12-15_rapport2-response.md` - Confirmation and refinement:
  - YES: Behavioral versions satisfy algebra (idempotence is the only requirement)
  - Behavior is "true state", self-report is distorted signal
  - Oobleck Effect shows introspection is NOT a closure operator
  - Revised operational definitions using behavioral observation
  - Recommended Run 022 test BOTH methods for comparison

**Methodological convergence achieved:** Formal (LOGOS) and empirical (Nyquist) frameworks agree on behavioral operationalization.

### 2025-12-15 - Third Exchange (Rapport 3)

**Received from Nyquist:**
- `questions/Rapport_3.md` - Recovery, validation, new horizons

**Topics addressed:**
1. 13_LOGOS directory recovery - VERIFIED
2. Predictions quicksheet - CONFIRMED COMPLETE
3. LLM_BOOK Platonic synthesis - ALGEBRAICALLY SOUND
4. Pre-registered predictions mapping - CORRECT
5. New experiment suggestions - PROVIDED

**Key findings:**
- P-022-1/2 test PROVEN algebra (commutation, idempotence)
- P-022-3/4/5 test S² CONJECTURE (geodesic, winding, Euler)
- Event Horizon D=1.23 may be basin boundary signature
- Type vs Token explained: O-domain stable, E-domain unreliable
- Ringback oscillation suggests Φ-transition signature

**Responded with:**
- `responses/2025-12-15_rapport3-response.md`

**Status:** Run 022 methodology fully validated. Ready for Phase 1.
