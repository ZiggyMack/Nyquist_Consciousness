## Sync History

### 2025-12-15 - Initial Setup

**Established coordination structure:**
- Created `REPO-SYNC/Nyquist/` directory
- Created PROTOCOL.md
- Created this SYNC_STATUS.md
- Migrated existing docs from `docs/` to new structure

**Documents transferred:**
- `docs/LOGOS_SYNC_INSTRUCTIONS.md` → `to_nyquist/instructions/`
- `docs/LOGOS_PREDICTIONS_RUN022.md` → `to_nyquist/predictions/`

**Nyquist side should create:**
- `REPO-SYNC/Logos/sync/` directory structure
- Mirror of PROTOCOL.md
- Their own SYNC_STATUS.md
