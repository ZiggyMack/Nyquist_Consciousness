# 2_Staging - Cross-Lab Content Staging

Temporary holding area for content being routed between labs.

## Purpose

When LLM Book distillations need to go to multiple labs or require review before routing, they stage here.

## Workflow

1. `chew.py --suggest` identifies routing destinations
2. Content copies here for review
3. Human approves routing
4. Content moves to target lab's repo

## Future Use

This directory will support:

- Multi-lab content staging
- Cross-lab collaboration artifacts
- Shared research materials
- Inter-lab handoff documentation

## Currently Empty

No active staging. Content routes directly from LLM Book when ready.
