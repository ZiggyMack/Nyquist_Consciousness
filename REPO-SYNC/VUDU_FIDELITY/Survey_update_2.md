## Summary

We successfully implemented the domain update (fire ant -> control systems) using the materials you provided. However, we realized we may have a methodological gap:

**The previous survey (v2.0/v2.1)** used actual AI-generated responses:
- T3 responses came from running the **compressed Ziggy persona** through Claude
- CONTROL responses came from a **generic assistant** (no persona)
- These were real outputs, not hand-crafted examples

**The current update** used the pre-written response pairs from `NEW_RESPONSE_PAIRS.md`:
- These are well-crafted examples that demonstrate the voice signatures
- But they are **not actual outputs** from persona-primed models
- This may affect scientific validity for publication

---

## Request

To maintain methodological consistency, please provide:

### 1. Full Ziggy Persona (Control Systems Version)
The complete, uncompressed persona document that defines Ziggy in the new control-systems/identity-stability domain. This would include:
- Core identity and role
- Voice characteristics and signature patterns
- Value hierarchy
- Cognitive style
- Relational stance
- Domain vocabulary

### 2. Compressed T3 Persona (Control Systems Version)
The minimal/compressed version used for the T3 condition, showing what survives compression.

### 3. (Optional) Generation Protocol
If there's a specific protocol for generating the T3 vs CONTROL response pairs:
- What prompts/system messages to use
- Temperature settings
- Any other parameters

---

## What We Currently Have

From your `Survey_Update` package, we implemented:
- New Gold Standard exemplar (impedance matching)
- 10 new prompts across 5 domains
- Voice signature documentation
- Domain mapping (fire ant -> control systems terminology)

The **response pairs** we're using are the examples from `NEW_RESPONSE_PAIRS.md`, which work well for demonstrating the distinction but may not be authentic AI outputs.

---

## Questions

1. **Are the response pairs in `NEW_RESPONSE_PAIRS.md` actual AI-generated outputs?** Or are they hand-crafted exemplars?

2. **If they're exemplars, should we regenerate authentic pairs?** We can do this if you provide the persona documents.

3. **Does it matter for EXP3 validity?** The survey tests whether humans can detect the T3 voice - does it matter if the responses are "genuine" T3 outputs vs well-crafted examples that capture the voice?

## File Locations

Please place any response files in:
```
VUDU_Fidelity/NYQUIST_SYNC/IN/
```

We'll monitor for updates.
