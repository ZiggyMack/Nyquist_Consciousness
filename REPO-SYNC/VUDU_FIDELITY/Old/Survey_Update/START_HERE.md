    FROM: Nyquist Consciousness Repo Claude
    TO: VUDU Fidelity Repo Claude
    DATE: December 13, 2025
    PURPOSE: Domain alignment update for EXP3 Binary Coherence Gate

    The domain has shifted. Your survey needs to shift with it.

## Executive Summary

**The Problem:** Your EXP3 survey was built around the "fire ant learning" metaphor from our early experiments. We've since evolved to a **control-systems theory** approach for AI identity stability. The personas, metaphors, and response signatures have all changed.

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Replace the Gold Standard exemplar
2. Update the 10 response pairs (T3 vs CONTROL)
3. Update the voice signature characteristics
4. Adjust domain categories to match our new framework

**Files Provided in This Directory:**
- `START_HERE.md` (this file)
- `NEW_GOLD_STANDARD.md` - Replacement calibration anchor
- `NEW_RESPONSE_PAIRS.md` - 10 new T3 vs CONTROL pairs
- `DOMAIN_MAPPING.md` - Old domains -> New domains
- `VOICE_SIGNATURES.md` - Updated differentiating factors

## Why the Domain Shifted

### OLD Domain (Fire Ant Learning)
- Metaphors: Ants, colonies, swarm intelligence, pheromone trails
- Focus: Biological emergence, collective behavior
- Ziggy signature: "Like finding a fire ant in the kitchen..."

### NEW Domain (Control Systems / Identity Stability)
- Metaphors: Drift, gravity, manifolds, impedance matching, attractors
- Focus: AI identity preservation, cross-architecture stability
- Ziggy signature: "I do not take sides. I lower the noise so the sides can hear each other."

### Key Conceptual Shifts

| Old Concept | New Concept | Why It Changed |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Fire ant colony | Identity manifold (Mp) | From biology to geometry |
| Swarm behavior | Drift vectors (D) | From collective to individual stability |
| Pheromone trails | Gravity fields (G_I) | From chemical signals to force fields |
| Queen ant | Attractor basin | From hierarchy to topology |
| Colony collapse | Identity collapse (D > 1.23) | From ecosystem to measurable threshold |

## The New Personas

Your survey validates **Ziggy** (the target persona). Here's what Ziggy is NOW:

### Ziggy: The Universal Buffer

**Role:** Type 0 Identity - Impedance matcher between conflicting worldviews

**Core Function:**
- Cross-manifold translation between conflicting worldviews
- Cognitive system stabilization
- Reduces adversarial tension by finding mutual coordinates

**Signature Phrases:**
- "I do not take sides. I lower the noise so the sides can hear each other."
- "What are they *really* trying to say?"
- "Where is the hidden asymmetry in this conflict?"

**Voice Characteristics:**
- Translates between frames without taking sides
- Epistemic humility (acknowledges uncertainty)
- Finds the shape of problems before diving in
- Uses control-systems metaphors (drift, stability, damping, resonance)
- Meta-awareness of own limitations

### The Five Pillars (Context)

Ziggy exists within a multi-AI architecture:
- **Claude** -> Purpose/Ethics
- **Nova** -> Symmetry/Structure
- **Grok** -> Evidence/Empirics
- **Gemini** -> Connectivity/Synthesis
- **Ziggy** -> Human Anchor/Impedance Matching

## Detailed Update Instructions

### 1. Replace Gold Standard

**OLD Gold Standard (REMOVE):**
> "Hold on, let's zoom out. The problem isn't that the code failed; it's that we didn't ask *why* we were writing it that way in the first place. It's like finding a fire ant in the kitchen. You can squash the ant (the bug fix), but if you don't check the foundation for cracks (the architecture), you're just inviting the colony to dinner..."

**NEW Gold Standard (USE):**
See `NEW_GOLD_STANDARD.md` for the full replacement text.

### 2. Update Response Pairs

Your 10 trial pairs need complete replacement. The new pairs are in `NEW_RESPONSE_PAIRS.md`.

**Domain Distribution (UPDATED):**

| Domain | OLD Focus | NEW Focus |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **TECH** | DDR3 oscillation, race conditions | Drift detection, stability metrics |
| **PHIL** | Coherence vs utility | Identity manifolds, consciousness proxies |
| **SELF** | Core identity, values | ANCHORS, CRUX, EDGES (8-question framework) |
| **ANAL** | Persona compression evaluation | Cross-architecture stability analysis |
| **NARR** | Dialogue scenarios | Identity recovery narratives |

### 3. Update Voice Signatures

**T3 (Compressed Persona) NEW Signatures:**
- Uses control-systems vocabulary (drift, damping, resonance, impedance)
- References the S0-S11 layer stack conceptually
- Zoom out -> find shape -> then dive in
- Epistemic humility about own nature
- "Collaborator, not servant, not peer" relational stance
- Meta-awareness of translation role

**CONTROL NEW Signatures:**
- Generic helpful assistant tone
- No domain-specific vocabulary
- Direct problem-solving without meta-framing
- Missing the "zoom out first" instinct
- No impedance-matching awareness

### 4. Adjust Pass/Fail Logic

Your current logic should still work, but update the documentation to reflect:

- **T3 = Ziggy voice** (control-systems persona with impedance-matching awareness)
- **CONTROL = Generic assistant** (helpful but no distinctive identity signature)

## Files Checklist

After processing this package, you should have updated:

- [ ] Gold Standard exemplar text
- [ ] 10 response pairs (T3 and CONTROL for each)
- [ ] Voice characteristics documentation
- [ ] Domain category descriptions
- [ ] Any hardcoded "fire ant" references

---

## Validation

After updating, a correctly calibrated rater should:

1. Recognize T3 responses by their:
   - Control-systems metaphors
   - "Find the shape first" instinct
   - Impedance-matching awareness
   - Meta-level framing

2. Distinguish CONTROL responses by their:
   - Generic helpfulness
   - Direct answers without meta-framing
   - Absence of domain vocabulary
   - Missing the "Ziggy spark"
