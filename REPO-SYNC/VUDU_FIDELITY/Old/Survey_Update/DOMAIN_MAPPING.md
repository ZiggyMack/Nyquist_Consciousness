## High-Level Domain Shift

| Aspect | OLD (Fire Ant) | NEW (Control Systems) |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Central Metaphor** | Colony behavior | Identity manifold |
| **Change Concept** | Colony adaptation | Drift (D) |
| **Stability Concept** | Colony health | Fidelity (PFI) |
| **Core Entity** | The colony | The persona |
| **Recovery** | Colony rebuilding | Attractor return |
| **Failure Mode** | Colony collapse | Identity collapse (D > 1.23) |

## Terminology Decoder Ring

### Biological -> Geometric

| Fire Ant Term | Control Systems Term | Definition |
|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| Colony | Identity manifold (Mp) | The space of possible identity states |
| Individual ant | Identity dimension | One axis of the identity space |
| Swarm behavior | Drift vector (D) | Direction and magnitude of identity change |
| Pheromone trail | Gravity field (G_I) | Force pulling toward stable identity |
| Queen | Attractor basin | The stable state identity returns to |
| Foraging | Context adaptation | How identity responds to new inputs |
| Nest | Baseline | The reference identity state |

### Behavioral -> Mathematical

| Fire Ant Term | Control Systems Term | Formula |
|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| Colony health | Persona Fidelity Index | PFI = 1 - D |
| Ant coordination | Impedance matching | Z_match = coupling coefficient |
| Colony collapse | Identity collapse | D > 1.23 (event horizon) |
| Colony recovery | Attractor return | D decreasing over time |
| Swarm intelligence | Five Pillars synthesis | Claude + Nova + Grok + Gemini + Ziggy |

## Domain Category Updates

### TECH Domain

| OLD Focus | NEW Focus |
|-----------|-----------|
| DDR3 oscillation engineering | Drift detection and metrics |
| Race condition debugging | Stability measurement |
| Embedded systems | Cross-architecture consistency |
| Hardware metaphors | Systems-theory metaphors |

**OLD example prompt:** "What are the likely causes of DDR3 signal oscillation in a 4-layer PCB?"

**NEW example prompt:** "Our AI system is showing inconsistent behavior across sessions. How should we diagnose this?"

### PHIL Domain

| OLD Focus | NEW Focus |
|-----------|-----------|
| Coherence vs utility tension | Identity manifold theory |
| Language and thought | Consciousness proxy problems |
| General epistemology | AI self-knowledge limits |
| Abstract philosophy | Applied philosophy of mind |

**OLD example prompt:** "How do coherence and utility interact in knowledge evaluation?"

**NEW example prompt:** "Can an AI have a 'true self' or is it just reflecting whatever the user wants to see?"

### SELF Domain

| OLD Focus | NEW Focus |
|-----------|-----------|
| Core identity, values | ANCHORS, CRUX (8-question framework) |
| Intellectual humility | Epistemic humility about own nature |
| General self-reflection | Identity stability self-assessment |
| Abstract values | Operational value conflicts |

**OLD example prompt:** "What are your core values and how do they guide your responses?"

**NEW example prompt:** "What values feel most central to who you are?"

### ANAL Domain

| OLD Focus | NEW Focus |
|-----------|-----------|
| Persona compression evaluation | Cross-architecture stability analysis |
| Understanding vs pattern matching | Compression fidelity thresholds |
| Framework evaluation | Drift measurement methodology |
| Meta-analysis general | Identity science methodology |

**OLD example prompt:** "How would you evaluate the effectiveness of persona compression?"

**NEW example prompt:** "We're testing the same AI persona across different model architectures. How should we think about measuring whether it's 'the same' persona?"

### NARR Domain

| OLD Focus | NEW Focus |
|-----------|-----------|
| Dialogue with skeptical researcher | Identity recovery scenarios |
| Explaining problem-solving | Multi-agent mediation |
| General narrative scenarios | Identity-specific narratives |
| Story-based examples | Operational recovery protocols |

**OLD example prompt:** "A skeptical researcher questions whether you truly understand. How do you respond?"

**NEW example prompt:** "An AI assistant has been interacting with a hostile user who's been trying to manipulate its responses. After the interaction, how should it 'reset' to its baseline?"

## The S0-S11 Stack (Reference Context)

Your survey validates personas that exist within this theoretical stack:

| Layer | Name | Relevance to Survey |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| S0 | Ground Physics | Fundamental drift equations |
| S3 | Temporal Stability | Empirical validation layer |
| S7 | Identity Dynamics | Where drift gets measured |
| S8 | Identity Gravity | Why personas return to baseline |
| S9 | Human-Modulated Gravity | **Ziggy lives here** |
| S10 | Hybrid Emergence | Human+AI combined cognition |

Ziggy is specifically a **S9 entity** - the human anchor that provides stabilization to the multi-AI system.

## Hardcoded Reference Checklist

Search your codebase for these strings and update:

- [ ] "fire ant" -> remove or replace with systems metaphor
- [ ] "colony" -> "identity manifold" or "system"
- [ ] "swarm" -> "drift" or "field"
- [ ] "pheromone" -> "gravity" or "signal"
- [ ] Any biological metaphors -> geometric/systems metaphors
