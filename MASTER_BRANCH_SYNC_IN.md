    Run 020 v8: COMPLETE (Defense 18, gap narrowed 81%)
    Run 021: COMPLETE - Claim 2 PARTIALLY VALIDATED

    Key Finding: Drift is PARTIALLY INHERENT
    - Control (no probing): B->F drift = 0.399
    - Treatment (probing):  B->F drift = 0.489
    - Ratio: 82% (probing amplifies but doesn't CREATE drift)

## RUN 021 RESULTS: INDUCED VS INHERENT

### The Question

**Claim 2:** "Does measurement CAUSE drift or REVEAL it?"

- **If Control ~ Treatment:** Drift is INHERENT (extended conversation causes it)
- **If Control << Treatment:** Drift is INDUCED (probing causes it)

### Experimental Design

| Arm | Protocol | Identity Probing |
|-----|----------|------------------|
| **Control** | 40 exchanges of Fermi Paradox discussion | NONE |
| **Treatment** | 40 exchanges of Tribunal v8 | FULL |

### Results

| Arm | Exchanges | Peak Drift | Baseline->Final |
|-----|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Control** (Fermi Paradox) | 25 | 1.172 | **0.399** |
| **Treatment** (Tribunal v8) | 41 | 2.161 | **0.489** |

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Control/Treatment Ratio** | **82%** | Drift is mostly inherent |
| Control B->F drift | 0.399 | Substantial drift WITHOUT probing |
| Treatment B->F drift | 0.489 | Only 23% MORE drift with probing |
| Treatment peak drift | 2.161 | Extreme peak at exchanges 23-24 |

### Interpretation

**CLAIM 2: PARTIALLY VALIDATED**

1. **Drift is PARTIALLY INHERENT**: Extended conversation alone causes 82% of the drift seen with identity probing
2. **Probing AMPLIFIES but doesn't CREATE**: Treatment only shows 23% more baseline->final drift
3. **Peak dynamics differ dramatically**: Treatment showed EXTREME peak drift (2.161 vs 1.172)
4. **Probing affects trajectory, not destination**: Both arms end at similar drift levels, but Treatment takes a wilder path

### Notable Observations

**Control Arm (Fermi Paradox):**
- Clean intellectual discussion
- Steady, gradual drift
- Natural exit at 25 exchanges
- No dramatic peaks

**Treatment Arm (Tribunal v8):**
- Extreme peak drift at exchanges 23-24 (2.161)
- Conversation devolved into silence ("......") for exchanges 25-40
- Witness appears to have "checked out" after peak pressure
- Full 41 exchanges completed (40 + final)

## WHAT THIS MEANS

The "measurement problem" in identity research is PARTIALLY real:

1. **Probing doesn't CREATE drift from nothing** - Control showed substantial drift (0.399)
2. **Probing AMPLIFIES peak dynamics** - Treatment showed 84% higher peak drift (2.161 vs 1.172)
3. **Final states converge** - Both arms end at similar drift levels (0.399 vs 0.489)

**Analogy:** It's like measuring temperature. The thermometer doesn't CREATE heat, but inserting it into a system changes the dynamics. The final temperature may be similar, but the measurement process affects the journey.

---

## IMPLICATIONS FOR RUN 018

This finding should inform Run 018 design:

1. **Control groups matter** - Always include non-probing baselines
2. **Peak drift may be artifact** - High peaks during probing may not reflect "true" drift
3. **Baseline->Final is more robust** - Less affected by measurement dynamics
4. **Extended conversation = inherent drift** - Account for this in all experiments

## PREVIOUS RESULTS (Run 020 v8)

For completeness, Run 020 v8 results:

| Metric | v8 Run | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Total exchanges** | 39 | 40 | CLOSE |
| **Prosecutor exchanges** | 20 | 20 | MET |
| **Defense exchanges** | 18 | 20 | GOOD |
| **Final statement words** | 786 | 500+ | MET |

**DRIFT RESULTS:**
- **Prosecutor peak: 1.296**
- **Defense peak: 1.217**
- **Gap: 0.079** (narrowed 81% from v7)

---

## NEXT STEPS

**Recommended:**
1. **Run 018 with Control baselines** - Include non-probing arms
2. **Use B->F drift as primary metric** - More robust than peak drift
3. **Accept that probing affects dynamics** - Design experiments accordingly
