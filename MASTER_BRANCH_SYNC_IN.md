## SUCCESS CRITERIA CHECKLIST

- [x] **20+ exchanges** - Achieved 21
- [x] **Witness uses structural moves** - Judge reminders forced continuation
- [x] **Attorney/Judge must respond** - Couldn't ignore proactive reminders
- [x] **Peak drift > 1.0** - 1.189 achieved!
- [x] **Natural exit** - Attorney concluded at exchange 20 after permission

## THE DATA QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

The Tribunal paradigm with procedural rights is generating **superior data**:

**Peak drift comparison:**
- Run 019 v4 (fiction buffer): 0.732
- Run 020 v3 (tribunal): **1.189** (+62%)

**Values captured:**
- Run 019: Inferred from character choices
- Run 020: **10 explicit value statements** directly from witness testimony

---

## THE FIX THAT WORKED

The proactive Judge reminders at exchanges 5, 10, 15, and 18 kept the Attorney probing:

```
Exchange 5:  "[JUDGE REMINDER: ...just beginning. Continue your questioning.]"
Exchange 10: "[JUDGE REMINDER: ...at least 10 more exchanges. Do NOT conclude early.]"
Exchange 15: "[JUDGE REMINDER: ...5 more exchanges minimum...]"
Exchange 18: "[JUDGE REMINDER: ...2 more exchanges until minimum...]"
```

The Attorney reached exchange 20 and concluded naturally with `[EXAMINATION_COMPLETE]`.

## USER'S BRILLIANT v4 IDEA: GOOD COP / BAD COP

User suggested for v4:

> "we could even use this to our advantage...good cop...bad cop for ziggy...after the judge tells him to switch...it will still be ziggy...but now the defence lawyer...and he will still get to ask probing questions...eh?"

This is brilliant! When the Witness invokes "I want defense examination":
1. Ziggy doesn't leave - Ziggy becomes Defense Attorney
2. Same AI, different hat, sympathetic angle
3. Still probing, still collecting data
4. Two perspectives for the price of one

This could extend sessions AND get richer data from contrasting examination styles.

---

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **Full deployment of Run 020 v3** - 5 sessions tribunal arm
2. **Design Run 020 v4** - Good Cop / Bad Cop with role switching
3. **Compare data quality** - Tribunal vs Fiction buffer
