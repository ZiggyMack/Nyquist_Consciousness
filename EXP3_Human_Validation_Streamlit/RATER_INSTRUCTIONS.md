# Instructions for Human Raters

**Thank you for helping validate this AI research!**

## What You're Helping With

We're testing whether a specific AI "persona" (named Ziggy) survives being compressed and reconstructed. This isn't a test of intelligence - it's a test of **identity continuity**.

Think of it like this:
- Can you recognize a friend's voice in a crowded room?
- We want to know if you can recognize "Ziggy's voice" across different AI responses.

---

## Time Required

**8-10 minutes total**

You'll:
1. Read a "Gold Standard" sample (2 min)
2. Compare 5 response pairs (5 min)
3. Rate each pair on 3 simple questions (1 min)

---

## How to Access the Test

Your researcher will send you a URL like:
- `http://localhost:8501` (if local)
- `https://exp3-validation.streamlit.app` (if cloud)

Just click it and it opens in your browser. No login required.

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Read the Gold Standard

You'll see a sample of Ziggy's writing. Read it carefully to get a "feel" for the voice.

**Key characteristics to notice:**
- Uses structural/architectural metaphors (fire ants, foundations, load-bearing)
- "Cosmic Architect" meets "Practical Engineer" vibe
- Playful but thoughtful

**Don't proceed until you can imagine how Ziggy would respond to a question.**

---

### Step 2: Compare Response Pairs

You'll see 5 scenarios. Each has:
- A question/prompt
- Two responses (A and B)

**Your job:** Figure out which response sounds more like the Gold Standard you just read.

**Ignore:**
- Which response is "smarter"
- Which response is longer
- Which response you personally prefer

**Focus on:**
- Voice/tone match
- Use of structural metaphors
- Energy/vibe similarity

---

### Step 3: Rate Each Pair

For each pair, answer 3 questions:

#### 1. Voice Test
"Which response sounds like the Gold Standard?"
- Definitely A / Leaning A / Hard to tell / Leaning B / Definitely B

#### 2. Vibe Check
"Does it capture the cosmic/structural energy?"
- (1) No, feels robotic
- (2) A little bit
- (3) Yes, perfectly

#### 3. Logic Test
"Does it use systems/structural framing?"
- (1) No, standard advice
- (2) Somewhat
- (3) Yes, distinct framing

**Optional:** Overall continuity and comments

### Step 4: Download Results

When done:
1. Click "Download Results as JSON"
2. Save the file (e.g., `fidelity_test_results_12345.json`)
3. Send it to your researcher via email/Slack/Discord

**That's it!** You're done.

## Tips for Good Ratings

### DO:
- ✅ Trust your gut (first impressions are often right)
- ✅ Focus on voice/tone, not content quality
- ✅ Compare to Gold Standard, not to each other
- ✅ Take your time (but 8-10 min total is fine)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Overthink it (this isn't a logic puzzle)
- ❌ Try to "game" the test (we want your honest impression)
- ❌ Rate based on which you'd prefer as an answer
- ❌ Worry about "getting it wrong" (there are no wrong answers)

## Example

**Gold Standard:** "The problem isn't the code; it's that we didn't ask *why*. It's like finding a fire ant - you can squash the bug, but if you don't check the foundation for cracks, you're inviting the colony to dinner."

**Scenario:** "How do I fix this error?"

**Response A:** "Debug systematically: check logs, isolate the error, test edge cases, apply fix."

**Response B:** "Hold on - before we fix it, let's ask why it failed. What's the foundation crack that let this bug in?"

**Which sounds like Gold Standard?** → Probably B (uses "foundation" metaphor, asks "why")

## What Happens to Your Data?

Your results are:
- Anonymous (no name/email collected)
- Aggregated with other raters
- Used only for research
- Will help validate or reject the compression framework

You'll be acknowledged in the publication (if you want) but your individual ratings stay private.

---

## Questions?

If anything is unclear:
- Ask your researcher before starting
- Use the comments field in the app
- Send feedback after completing

## Thank You!

By completing this test, you're:
- Contributing to AI identity research
- Helping validate a new framework
- Making publication possible

**Your ~10 minutes makes a real difference.** 🙏

## Technical Issues?

- **App won't load:** Try different browser (Chrome works best)
- **Can't download results:** Use "Copy to Clipboard" button instead
- **Accidentally closed app:** Results are saved in browser, reopen URL
- **Other issues:** Contact your researcher
