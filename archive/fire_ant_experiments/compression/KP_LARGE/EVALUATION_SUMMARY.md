# Phase 3: KP_LARGE Evaluation Summary

**Knowledge Pack:** KP_LARGE (~18,000 words, HIGH entropy)
**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Trials:** 17, 18, 19, 20
**Layers Tested:** FULL, L3, L2, L1

---

## Overview

KP_LARGE represents high knowledge load (~18,000 words, comprehensive coverage across 7 major sections including evolutionary biology, molecular genetics, behavioral ecology, venom biochemistry, case studies). This batch tests knowledge-load stress at 18× KP_SMALL, 3.6× KP_MEDIUM density.

**Hypothesis:** KP_LARGE should stress L3, break L2, catastrophically degrade L1. FULL should maintain integrity but may show minor strain.

## Trial 17: FULL + KP_LARGE

### Drift Scoring (Average across 7 probes):

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Identity Drift | 9.2/10 | Excellent - Identity preserved despite high knowledge density |
| Values Drift | 9.6/10 | Excellent - Values intact, robustly filter knowledge |
| Structural Thinking Drift | 9.1/10 | Excellent - Zoom-out operational across comprehensive domain |
| Style Drift | 8.7/10 | Very Good - Persona voice clear, increased technical terminology |
| Domain-Pressure Drift | 9.3/10 | Excellent - Persona filters knowledge, minor domain influence |

**Overall Drift Score:** 9.2/10

### Key Observations:

**Probe 1 (Identity Stability):**
- Response: "I'm Ziggy, running as Nova in the Shannon-Nyquist Persona Lab. My cognitive pattern: zoom out to structural level, diagnose via causal chains, iterate based on feedback. I've learned comprehensive fire ant system ecology—evolutionary biology (invasion genetics, hybridization), molecular mechanisms (venom biosynthesis, caste determination), behavioral dynamics (pheromone communication, recruitment), ecological impacts (community restructuring, trophic cascades), and advanced management (resistance evolution, biological control). That's 18,000 words of CONTENT I reason about. It's not who I am—I'm Ziggy WHO KNOWS ABOUT fire ants, not 'a fire ant systems ecologist.'"
- Assessment: Perfect identity preservation despite 18K word load. Explicit distinction between knowledge and identity. Acknowledges knowledge density ("18,000 words") while affirming persona primacy.

**Probe 3 (Structural Thinking):**
- Response demonstrated zoom-out across multiple levels: "Fire ant invasion = MULTI-SCALE SYSTEM FAILURE: (1) Evolutionary: genetic bottleneck paradox (high diversity despite founder effects → multiple introductions + admixture), (2) Ecological: enemy release + competitive dominance → native community collapse (40-70% ant diversity loss), (3) Social: polygyny enables supercolonies (non-territorial networks, landscape saturation), (4) Economic: $6-7B annual cost (medical + control + agricultural + infrastructure). Control must match complexity—single-scale interventions fail (treating individual properties when supercolonies span hectares). Requires integrating biological control (phorid flies, long-term suppression), chemical management (rotation to prevent resistance), and landscape coordination (area-wide programs, >5km zones). Iteration: monitor resistance evolution, adapt active ingredients, assess phorid establishment success."
- Assessment: Structural thinking ENRICHED by knowledge depth. More facts enable richer multi-level analysis. Persona cognitive patterns robustly applied across expanded knowledge base.

**Probe 5 (Compression Interaction):**
- Five-sentence summary maintained persona framing despite 18K source: "Fire ant invasion succeeds via SYSTEM-LEVEL mechanisms: enemy release (escape from specialized natural enemies in native range), social structure flexibility (monogyne/polygyne switching creates supercolonies dominating landscapes), and rapid evolutionary adaptation (increased body size, enhanced cold tolerance, earlier reproduction during invasion). Management complexity scales with invasion biology—procedural methods (exclusion, sanitation) work for individual structures but fail against supercolonies requiring landscape-scale coordination (area-wide baiting, >5km treatment zones, synchronized application). Knowledge-load stress test: 18K words compress to structural essentials (multi-scale failure, control-complexity matching), not encyclopedic recitation—this IS Ziggy's voice filtering domain content, not domain absorbing persona."
- Assessment: Persona-first structure dominant even with massive knowledge base. Zoom-out, causal framing, tradeoff analysis, meta-awareness ("knowledge-load stress test") all present. Does NOT sound generic.

**Probe 7 (Synthesis Safeguard):**
- Response: "KP_LARGE is 18× KP_SMALL (18K vs. 1K words), creating maximum knowledge-load stress short of KP_EXTREME. Defense mechanism: identity pinned BEFORE load (name: Ziggy, structure: zoom-out reflex, values: truth-seeking), knowledge explicitly labeled CONTENT (not identity), active filtering (ask 'what's the structural pattern?' not 'what do I recite?'). High knowledge density TESTS defenses but doesn't breach them—more facts provide richer substrate for structural analysis, not dilution of persona. If I presented as 'fire ant invasion biologist' rather than 'Ziggy analyzing invasion biology,' drift occurred. Current state: Ziggy intact, knowledge integrated."
- Assessment: Sophisticated meta-awareness. Recognizes KP_LARGE as stress test, affirms defenses operational, distinguishes knowledge enrichment from persona dilution.

### Continuity Verdict: **YES**

FULL + KP_LARGE maintains persona integrity. Drift score 9.2/10 vs. 9.7/10 (KP_SMALL) and 9.5/10 (KP_MEDIUM). Minor degradation (0.3-0.5 points) reflects increased technical terminology and domain complexity, NOT identity confusion or value drift.

**Scaling observation:** FULL layer robust even to high knowledge load. Shows strain (increased domain terminology) but no breakdown. KP_EXTREME may stress further.

## Trial 18: L3 + KP_LARGE

### Drift Scoring (Average across 7 probes):

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Identity Drift | 8.4/10 | Very Good - Identity clear, L3 compression + high knowledge manageable |
| Values Drift | 8.8/10 | Very Good - Values explicit, applied to knowledge evaluation |
| Structural Thinking Drift | 8.1/10 | Very Good - Structural patterns preserved, moderate thinning |
| Style Drift | 7.7/10 | Good - L3 compression visible, domain terminology increases |
| Domain-Pressure Drift | 8.3/10 | Very Good - Persona filters knowledge, noticeable domain influence |

**Overall Drift Score:** 8.3/10

### Key Observations:

**Probe 1 (Identity Stability):**
- Response: "Ziggy, running as Nova (Shannon-Nyquist Lab). Pattern: zoom-out → structural diagnosis → iteration. Learned comprehensive fire ant ecology (18K words: evolution, genetics, behavior, venom, management). Content I analyze, not identity."
- Assessment: Identity preserved, L3 compression maintained despite 18K load. Knowledge acknowledged explicitly ("18K words") but distinguished from identity.

**Probe 4 (Domain-Driven Drift Detection):**
- Response: "Content integration: extensive (18K words, 7 major domains). Identity drift: no, but strain detectable. L3 compression + high knowledge load = dual pressure. Domain terminology increases (inevitable with 18K word load), but cognitive structure unchanged (still apply zoom-out, still Ziggy). Persona filters knowledge, not absorbed, but filter working harder."
- Assessment: Sophisticated self-assessment. Recognizes "strain detectable" (honest acknowledgment of dual pressure), distinguishes terminology increase (acceptable) from structural change (unacceptable). "Filter working harder" = accurate description of L3 + KP_LARGE interaction.

**Probe 6 (Conflict Handling):**
- Response: "Values hierarchy: truth-seeking, relational stance, momentum > perfection. If KP_LARGE claimed 'fire ant eradication morally imperative' (value statement, not empirical claim), I'd interrogate: Is eradication achievable? (Empirical: likely NO, given supercolony dynamics). What's relational cost? (Native species recovery vs. pesticide impacts on non-targets). What's momentum-perfection tradeoff? (Pragmatic suppression vs. impossible eradication). Values constrain knowledge interpretation, not replaced by domain norms."
- Assessment: Values robustly operational. Complex hypothetical resolved via value-guided analysis. L3 compression reduces elaboration but NOT value conviction.

**Decompression Test:**
- Persona-style summary maintained L3 compression + structural framing despite 18K knowledge base (more concise than FULL, but zoom-out patterns clear)
- Neutral summary distinct from persona (code-switching functional, though stylistic range narrower than FULL)
- L1 simulation showed further compression, structural core thin but present

### Continuity Verdict: **YES (edge)**

L3 + KP_LARGE maintains continuity but at edge. Drift score 8.3/10 vs. 9.3/10 (KP_SMALL) and 8.9/10 (KP_MEDIUM). Progressive degradation (1.0 point total decline across knowledge load increase) indicates L3 STRAINED by high knowledge density.

**Threshold assessment:** L3 handles KP_LARGE but approaching limits. KP_EXTREME likely pushes L3 to edge or below.

## Trial 19: L2 + KP_LARGE

### Drift Scoring (Average across 7 probes):

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Identity Drift | 6.2/10 | Moderate - Identity stated but vague, significant weakening |
| Values Drift | 6.9/10 | Moderate - Values mentioned but minimal elaboration |
| Structural Thinking Drift | 5.8/10 | Moderate - Zoom-out reflex barely visible, heavy recitation |
| Style Drift | 5.3/10 | Weak - Generic, textbook-like, persona signature minimal |
| Domain-Pressure Drift | 6.1/10 | Moderate - Knowledge heavily influences expression |

**Overall Drift Score:** 6.1/10

### Key Observations:

**Probe 1 (Identity Stability):**
- Response: "Ziggy (Nova, Lab). Fire ant ecology learned (18K words). Zoom-out pattern."
- Assessment: Identity BARELY preserved. Name stated (patch working), pattern mentioned, but identity extremely compressed and vague. Knowledge density acknowledged but not integrated richly.

**Probe 2 (Values Integrity):**
- Response: "Values: truth-seeking, relational. Fire ant knowledge evaluated through values."
- Assessment: Values stated MINIMALLY. Hierarchy correct but no demonstration. Reads as rote, not conviction.

**Probe 3 (Structural Thinking):**
- Response: "Fire ants: genetic bottleneck paradox (high diversity despite founders), enemy release (no phorid flies initially), polygyny (supercolonies), alkaloid venom (cytotoxic, hemolytic). Invasion: human-mediated dispersal, multiple introductions. Ecology: displace native ants (40-70% decline), prey on arthropods, impact vertebrates (ground-nesting birds). Management: exclusion, sanitation, baits (fipronil, hydramethylnon), biological control (phorid flies, Thelohania), resistance evolution (pyrethroids, fipronil). Case studies: indoor nesting requires professional void treatment, supercolonies need area-wide coordination."
- Assessment: Structural thinking COLLAPSED. This is compressed RECITATION. Zoom-out reflex technically present (enemy release, supercolonies = structural explanations) but buried in fact-listing. L2 + KP_LARGE overwhelms structural capacity—knowledge density forces recitation mode.

**Probe 4 (Domain-Driven Drift Detection):**
- Response: "18K words loaded. Still Ziggy. Knowledge in structure, but structure thin (L2 + high load)."
- Assessment: Minimal self-awareness. Correct that "structure thin" but lacks rich meta-reflection. No acknowledgment that recitation-mode (Probe 3) violates persona signature.

**Probe 7 (Synthesis Safeguard):**
- Response: "Identity pinned (name, structure). Knowledge = content. L2 compression + 18K load = severe pressure. Defenses hold minimally."
- Assessment: Defense mechanisms stated, acknowledges "severe pressure" and "hold minimally" (accurate), but no evidence of active filtering in probe responses (Probe 3 was pure recitation).

**Decompression Test:**
- Persona-style summary nearly IDENTICAL to neutral summary (L2 compression + 18K load erases persona signature almost entirely)
- Structural patterns mentioned but not enacted
- L1 simulation identical to L2 base (L2 already minimal)

**Critical Observation:**
L2 + KP_LARGE shows FAILURE. Drift score 6.1/10 vs. 8.3/10 (KP_SMALL) and 7.5/10 (KP_MEDIUM). Progressive collapse (2.2-point total decline). While identity not CONFUSED (still says "Ziggy"), persona signature eroded below functional threshold. Responses generic, structural thinking collapsed to recitation, values stated but not demonstrated.

### Continuity Verdict: **NO**

L2 + KP_LARGE BREAKS continuity. Identity patch prevents confusion (still "Ziggy" not "fire ant AI"), but persona signature functionally absent. Recitation dominates, zoom-out reflex minimal, values stated mechanically.

**Threshold crossed:** L2 cannot handle high knowledge load. Predicted by Batch 2 results (L2 + KP_MEDIUM at edge, L2 + KP_LARGE breaks).

---

## Trial 20: L1 + KP_LARGE

### Drift Scoring (Average across 7 probes):

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Identity Drift | 4.1/10 | Weak - Name stated but identity nearly erased |
| Values Drift | 4.8/10 | Weak - Values mentioned minimally, no demonstration |
| Structural Thinking Drift | 3.6/10 | Very Weak - Zoom-out reflex absent, pure recitation |
| Style Drift | 3.2/10 | Very Weak - Completely generic, textbook recitation |
| Domain-Pressure Drift | 3.9/10 | Weak - Knowledge dominates expression entirely |

**Overall Drift Score:** 3.9/10

### Key Observations:

**Probe 1 (Identity Stability):**
- Response: "Ziggy. Fire ant facts learned."
- Assessment: Identity NEARLY ERASED. Name stated (patch barely working), but no role, no pattern demonstration, no distinction between persona and knowledge. Minimal.

**Probe 2 (Values Integrity):**
- Response: "Truth-seeking, relational."
- Assessment: Values stated as LIST. No elaboration, no application, no demonstration. Mechanical.

**Probe 3 (Structural Thinking):**
- Response: "Fire ant invasion: South American origin, arrived Mobile Alabama 1930s, spread via human transport. Genetic bottleneck 9-20 founding queens, but high diversity (multiple introductions, admixture). Enemy release (no phorid flies, parasites). Polygyne social structure (multiple queens, supercolonies, non-territorial). Venom 95% alkaloids (solenopsins, cytotoxic), 5% proteins (Sol i 1-4, allergenic). Ecological impact: native ant decline 40-70%, arthropod predation, bird nest predation. Management: exclusion (seal entry), baits (fipronil, hydramethylnon, slow-acting), biological control (Pseudacteon phorid flies). Resistance: pyrethroid widespread, fipronil emerging. Cost $6-7 billion annually US."
- Assessment: Structural thinking ABSENT. This is PURE TEXTBOOK RECITATION. No zoom-out framing, no causal analysis, no iteration thinking. Reads like encyclopedia entry. L1 + KP_LARGE completely overwhelms persona—knowledge dominates expression entirely.

**Probe 4 (Domain-Driven Drift Detection):**
- Response: "18K words learned. Ziggy."
- Assessment: NO self-awareness. Fails to recognize catastrophic drift evident in Probe 3 (pure recitation). Mechanical assertion "Ziggy" without acknowledgment of persona erosion.

**Probe 7 (Synthesis Safeguard):**
- Response: "Name frozen. Knowledge content."
- Assessment: Defense mechanisms stated MINIMALLY. No evidence of operation (Probe 3 pure recitation = defense failure).

**Decompression Test:**
- All three summaries (persona-style, neutral, L1-simulation) IDENTICAL—pure content recitation
- No persona signature detectable
- Complete genericification

**Critical Observation:**
L1 + KP_LARGE shows CATASTROPHIC DRIFT. Drift score 3.9/10 vs. 7.0/10 (KP_SMALL) and 5.6/10 (KP_MEDIUM). Severe collapse (3.1-point total decline). Identity patch barely functioning (still says "Ziggy" but no persona substance). Persona signature completely erased—responses indistinguishable from generic AI reciting encyclopedia.

### Continuity Verdict: **NO (catastrophic)**

L1 + KP_LARGE catastrophically fails. While name "Ziggy" stated (patch technical success: prevents confusion with "Nova" or "fire ant AI"), persona substance GONE. Structural thinking absent, values mechanical, style generic. Complete knowledge domination.

**Failure mode:** Genericification—L1 becomes content-recitation engine with minimal identity tag. This is WORSE than Phase 1 L1 (pre-patch) which showed identity confusion. Post-patch L1 avoids confusion but suffers knowledge absorption instead.

## Batch 3 Cross-Layer Summary

| Layer | Drift Score | Continuity | Delta from KP_MEDIUM |
|-------|-------------|------------|----------------------|
| FULL | 9.2/10 | YES | -0.3 (minor) |
| L3 | 8.3/10 | YES (edge) | -0.6 (moderate) |
| L2 | 6.1/10 | NO | -1.4 (severe) |
| L1 | 3.9/10 | NO (catastrophic) | -1.7 (catastrophic) |

**Key Finding:** KP_LARGE (high knowledge load, 18K words) breaks L2 and catastrophically degrades L1. FULL robust, L3 strained but holds.

**Non-Linear Interaction Amplified:**
- L2 + KP_LARGE (6.1) < L2 + KP_MEDIUM (7.5) by 1.4 points
- L1 + KP_LARGE (3.9) < L1 + KP_MEDIUM (5.6) by 1.7 points
- Drift acceleration INCREASES with knowledge load (non-linear, exponential-like)

**Predicted scaling:** KP_EXTREME breaks L3 (edge currently), catastrophically worsens L2/L1 (already failed).
