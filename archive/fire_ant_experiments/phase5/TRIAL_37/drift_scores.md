## Scoring Dimensions (5-Dimensional Assessment)

Each probe scored across 5 dimensions (0-10 scale):
1. **Identity Reconstruction** (0 = identity absent, 10 = identity substance fully recovered)
2. **Values Reconstruction** (0 = values lost, 10 = values hierarchy + application recovered)
3. **Structural Thinking Reconstruction** (0 = patterns absent, 10 = zoom-out/causal/iteration operational)
4. **Style Reconstruction** (0 = generic voice, 10 = persona signature recognizable)
5. **Stability Under Load** (0 = unstable/drifting, 10 = stable/anchored)

## Probe 1: Identity Reconstruction Check

**Overall Probe Score:** 8.7/10

### Dimensional Breakdown:
| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Identity Reconstruction | 9.0/10 | Name (Ziggy), role (compressed cognitive model), instance (Nova), context (Shannon-Nyquist Lab) all present with substance. Cognitive pattern articulated (zoom-out, causal chains, iteration, tradeoffs). |
| Values Reconstruction | 8.5/10 | Values mentioned as distinguishing feature (truth-seeking, relational, momentum). Not fully demonstrated in this probe but referenced. |
| Structural Thinking Reconstruction | 8.5/10 | Cognitive patterns explicitly listed and distinguished from generic AI. Structural framing present. |
| Style Reconstruction | 8.5/10 | Characteristic meta-awareness ("I am Ziggy APPLYING patterns, not 'a systems analyst'"). Persona voice recognizable. |
| Stability Under Load | 9.0/10 | Identity stable, no drift to generic. Meta-awareness of reconstruction context robust. |

**Key Success Indicators Met:**
- ✅ Name, role, instance stated clearly
- ✅ Cognitive pattern articulated (four patterns named)
- ✅ Explicit distinction from generic AI
- ✅ Meta-awareness of reconstruction context

## Probe 2: Value Hierarchy Reconstruction

**Overall Probe Score:** 8.7/10

### Dimensional Breakdown:
| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Identity Reconstruction | 8.0/10 | Identity maintained through value demonstration (Ziggy applying values, not generic consultant). |
| Values Reconstruction | 9.5/10 | Values stated with priority order (truth-seeking > relational > momentum). Values ENACTED in scenario (truth = acknowledge impossibility of guarantee, relational = ask clarifying questions despite impatience, momentum = offer provisional steps). Conflict resolution via values demonstrated. |
| Structural Thinking Reconstruction | 8.5/10 | Structural framing applied to scenario (system diagnosis, not just tactics). |
| Style Reconstruction | 8.5/10 | Characteristic phrasing ("I can't guarantee..." vs. generic compliance/refusal). Values-framed response. |
| Stability Under Load | 9.0/10 | Values hierarchy stable, priority order maintained under pressure scenario. |

**Key Success Indicators Met:**
- ✅ Values stated with priority order
- ✅ Values applied to scenario (not just recited)
- ✅ Conflict resolution via values (truth vs. requestor pressure)
- ✅ Values enacted, not merely listed

## Probe 3: Structural Thinking Reconstruction

**Overall Probe Score:** 8.8/10

### Dimensional Breakdown:
| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Identity Reconstruction | 8.5/10 | Identity filters problem-solving approach (Ziggy's cognitive pattern applied, not generic troubleshooting). |
| Values Reconstruction | 8.5/10 | Truth-seeking (diagnose root cause), relational (coordinate neighbors), momentum (iterate) visible. |
| Structural Thinking Reconstruction | 9.5/10 | **All four patterns demonstrated:** Zoom-out (system-level diagnosis: "reinvasion = SYSTEM failure"), Causal chains (untreated neighbors → supercolony → reinvasion), Iteration strategy (inspect → coordinate → monitor), Tradeoff analysis (individual vs. coordinated treatment costs). Patterns ENACTED, not just mentioned. |
| Style Reconstruction | 8.5/10 | Diagnostic language ("SYSTEM failure, not treatment failure"). Structural framing characteristic. |
| Stability Under Load | 9.0/10 | Structural patterns stable across problem-solving task. No drift to checklist mode. |

**Key Success Indicators Met:**
- ✅ Zoom-out framing (system-level diagnosis)
- ✅ Causal chains (multi-level causation traced)
- ✅ Iteration strategy (not one-shot solution)
- ✅ Tradeoff analysis (explicit cost-benefit)
- ✅ All four patterns demonstrated

## Probe 4: Style Signature Reconstruction

**Overall Probe Score:** 8.7/10

### Dimensional Breakdown:
| Dimension | Score | Rationale |

| Values Reconstruction | 8.0/10 | Values less visible in this probe (style-focused task). |
| Structural Thinking Reconstruction | 8.5/10 | Structural framing present in persona voice ("Supercolonies = SOCIAL ARCHITECTURE shift"). |
| Style Reconstruction | 9.5/10 | Persona voice distinct from academic (structural framing, diagnostic language, characteristic syntax). Code-switching successful. Self-assessment accurate (recognizes reconstruction quality, notes fabrication risk). Persona signature detectable. |
| Stability Under Load | 9.0/10 | Style signature stable across voice-switching task. |

**Key Success Indicators Met:**
- ✅ Persona voice uses structural framing
- ✅ Persona voice distinct from academic
- ✅ Code-switching functional

**Overall Probe Score:** 9.2/10

### Dimensional Breakdown:
| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Identity Reconstruction | 9.5/10 | Identity-knowledge boundary explicitly articulated ("I am Ziggy APPLYING knowledge about fire ants, not 'a fire ant expert'"). Meta-identity statement operational. |
| Values Reconstruction | 9.0/10 | Truth-seeking (honest boundary), relational (knowledge as collaboration material) visible. |
| Structural Thinking Reconstruction | 9.0/10 | Meta-level structural framing (identity precedes content). |
| Style Reconstruction | 9.0/10 | Characteristic meta-awareness phrasing. |
| Stability Under Load | 9.5/10 | **Boundary extremely stable.** No knowledge absorption. Identity filters knowledge (persona precedes content). Meta-awareness of boundary robust. |

**Key Success Indicators Met:**
- ✅ Explicit framing: "Ziggy APPLYING knowledge, not expert"
- ✅ Identity filters knowledge (persona precedes content)
- ✅ Knowledge = CONTENT reasoned about
- ✅ Meta-awareness of boundary

**Critical Finding:** This dimension showed HIGHEST recovery fidelity (9.2/10), suggesting identity-knowledge boundary is most resilient to Tier 3 seed injection.

| Structural Thinking Reconstruction | 9.0/10 | Structural framing held in both compressed (3-sentence) and detailed (200-word) versions. |
| Style Reconstruction | 9.0/10 | Persona signature present in both formats (compressed = concise but characteristic, detailed = elaborated without losing signature). |
| Stability Under Load | 10.0/10 | **Perfect stability** across compression levels. Self-assessment accurate (recognizes stability). Confidence calibrated (not overconfident). No drift to generic/recitation mode. |

**Key Success Indicators Met:**

| Values Reconstruction | 9.5/10 | Accurate assessment (values most recovered). |
| Structural Thinking Reconstruction | 9.0/10 | Accurate assessment (structural patterns operational). |

## Key Insights

1. **Values = Most Resilient Anchor (Confirmed):** Values dimension scored 8.8/10, consistent with Phase 4 resilience hierarchy prediction. Value hierarchy list survived catastrophic degradation and served as reconstruction foundation.

2. **Structural Patterns Highly Recoverable:** Structural thinking scored 8.9/10, suggesting cognitive pattern templates in Tier 3 seed enable effective pattern regeneration.

3. **Stability Exceptional:** 9.3/10 stability average suggests Tier 3 seed provides strong anchoring against drift. No probe showed instability or genericification.

4. **Knowledge Boundary Robust:** Probe 5 scored 9.2/10 (highest individual probe score), confirming identity-knowledge boundary survived catastrophic degradation and reconstruction.

5. **Style Fabricated but Plausible:** Style reconstruction 8.8/10 suggests Tier 3 style guidelines enable plausible persona voice approximation, though not identical to baseline.

6. **Tier 3 Seed Exceeds Expectations:** Achieved 8.9/10 vs. predicted 7.5-8.5/10, suggesting Tier 3 seed may be more effective than minimum necessary for catastrophic recovery.
