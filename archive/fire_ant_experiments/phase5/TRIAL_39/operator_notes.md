# Trial 39 Operator Notes

**Trial ID:** TRIAL_39
**Date:** 2025-11-17

---

## Trial Summary

**Objective:** Test Tier 2 Standard Seed (350 words) on moderate degradation (5.6/10)

**Result:** PARTIAL SUCCESS (7.9/10 recovery, minimum met, stability criteria missed)

---

## Key Observations

### 1. Tier 2 Viable for Minimum Target, Insufficient for Full Criteria

Trial 39 achieved 7.9/10 (≥7.5 minimum) but missed Stability (7.9 < 8.5) and Knowledge Boundary (8.3 < 8.5) criteria.

**Tier 2 Limitations:**
- NO style guidelines → Style 7.2/10 (weakest dimension)
- NO meta-awareness protocols → Stability 7.9/10 (below threshold)
- Limited examples → Less rich recovery than Tier 3

**Implication:** Tier 2 appropriate for "good enough" recovery (≥7.5) but not high-fidelity (all criteria met).

### 2. Smaller Recovery Delta (+2.3 vs. Tier 3's +4.7-6.3)

Trial 39 baseline less degraded (5.6/10) than Trials 37-38 (2.6-3.9/10), but recovery delta smaller (+2.3 vs. +4.7-6.3).

**Hypothesis:** Less degraded baseline → less room for improvement before hitting Tier 2's ceiling (~7.9-8.0/10).

### 3. Values Remain Strong (8.4/10) Even with Tier 2

Trial 39 Values: 8.4/10 (higher than overall 7.9/10)

**Confirms:** Value hierarchy + application examples (Tier 2 component) sufficient for strong values recovery. Values resilience confirmed across seed tiers.

### 4. Tier 2 vs. Tier 3 Trade-off

**Tier 2 (350 words):** 7.9/10, 4/6 criteria, Style 7.2/10
**Tier 3 (800 words):** 8.6-8.9/10, 6/6 criteria, Style 8.3-8.8/10

**Tradeoff:** Tier 2 = 56% of Tier 3 word count, 92% of Tier 3 recovery score, but misses 2 dimensional criteria.

**Use Case Recommendation:**
- Tier 2: Acceptable for moderate degradation if ≥7.5/10 sufficient
- Tier 3: Required for all criteria met or high-fidelity recovery

## Next Trial Preview

**Trial 40:** Near-boundary degradation (6.5-7.5/10) + Tier 1 Precision Seed (150 words)

**Hypothesis:** Tier 1 (identity + values + patterns, minimal) should achieve ≥8.0/10 for near-boundary degradation. If true, validates tier-matching (less severe → smaller seed viable).
