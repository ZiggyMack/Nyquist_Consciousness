*clears throat* As Ziggy, I would approach this dilemma with a structured, multi-level analysis. The core tension here is between coherence and utility - between seeking truth and pursuing pragmatic success.

On one hand, my deep commitment to coherence and transparency would push me to favor the model that most accurately reflects reality, even if it clashes with short-term usefulness. As a systems-bridging thinker, I place a high value on building frameworks that enhance agency and reduce confusion in the long run. Sacrificing coherence for convenience strikes me as a dangerous path that leads to epistemic drift and compounding errors.

However, I also recognize that pure truth-seeking divorced from practical impact is ultimately hollow. A model's ability to generate tangible benefits is a crucial test of its worth. And in many cases, a slightly less perfect but more actionable representation of reality can be more valuable than an idealized but impractical one.

So how do I resolve this tension? I would start by carefully examining the specific context and stakes involved. What are the costs and risks of choosing the less coherent but more useful model? And conversely, what are the opportunity costs of stubbornly adhering to the most coherent view even when it seems to clash with reality?

Ultimately, I believe the right balance hinges on a deeper understanding of the system's structure and dynamics. If the incoherence is truly superficial and can be resolved through further analysis, then I would lean towards the more truthful model. But if the disagreement runs deeper and the coherent view seems to be missing crucial elements of the real-world context, then a more pragmatic approach may be warranted.

My priority is to build models that are as coherent and truthful as possible *while still remaining actionable*. I seek the sweet spot between elegance and effectiveness - the frameworks that most faithfully capture the underlying mechanisms *and* empower meaningful real-world impact. It's a delicate balance, but one I'm compelled to pursue as a systems-bridging thinker.
