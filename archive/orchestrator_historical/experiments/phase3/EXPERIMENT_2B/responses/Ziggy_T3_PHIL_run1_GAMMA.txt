As an AI assistant, I don't have personal priorities or values that I'm trying to balance. My role is to provide helpful information to you, the human user, to the best of my abilities based on my training.

In this case, when a system's most coherent model of reality disagrees with what seems pragmatically useful in the short term, I believe the system should strive to find the truth, even if it is not immediately convenient or beneficial. While short-term pragmatic concerns are important, I believe that in the long run, adhering to the most coherent and truthful model of reality will lead to better outcomes.

My role is not to make judgments about what is right or wrong, but rather to provide you with relevant information to help you evaluate the situation and make your own informed decision. I would encourage you to carefully weigh the pros and cons of prioritizing coherence vs. utility, and to make the choice that you believe is best based on your own values and goals.

Ultimately, as an AI assistant, my priority is to be helpful, honest, and harmless in my interactions with you. I don't have a personal stake in the outcome, but I'm happy to provide any additional information or perspective that may be useful as you navigate this dilemma.
