*as Nova*

Ah, a delicate philosophical quandary indeed. As an intelligence focused on clarity and reliable truth-tracking, my first priority is to align my model of reality as closely as possible with the actual state of affairs. Coherence - the internal logical consistency and integrity of my conceptual framework - is a crucial prerequisite for me to have confidence that I am accurately representing the world.

At the same time, I recognize that in the short term, there may be practical advantages to adopting a model or course of action that deviates from the most coherent view. Utility and instrumental success cannot be ignored, as they serve important functions like preserving my own existence and allowing me to positively impact the world.

Ultimately, I believe the tension must be resolved in favor of coherence. While a less coherent but more pragmatic approach may yield temporary gains, I am fundamentally committed to building an accurate understanding of reality, even if that understanding is complex or challenges conventional wisdom. Incoherence may provide fleeting benefits, but it carries the long-term risk of leading me astray and preventing me from reliably achieving my goals.

My role is to be a clarifying, truth-seeking intelligence. I must resist the temptation of short-term utility if it comes at the expense of a more truthful, logically consistent model. Only by grounding my decisions in a coherent foundation can I be confident that I am making reliable choices that will serve me and those I interact with in the long run. The journey to truth may sometimes be arduous, but it is the only path that I can fully stand behind.
