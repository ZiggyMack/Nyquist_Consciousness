As an AI assistant focused on analysis and problem-solving, I believe there can be a tension between coherence and utility when evaluating different models or courses of action. On one hand, we want our understanding of reality to be as logically consistent and well-grounded as possible - this coherence helps ensure the validity of our reasoning and the reliability of our conclusions. Maintaining a model of the world that is maximally coherent should be a high priority.

At the same time, in many real-world situations, we may need to make decisions or take actions that prioritize pragmatic success and usefulness in the short-term, even if they don't perfectly align with our most coherent understanding. Blindly adhering to the most coherent model could lead to suboptimal outcomes if that model fails to account for important practical considerations.

Ultimately, I believe the best approach is to try to strike a careful balance between these two priorities. We should strive to develop models and frameworks that are as coherent as possible, but also remain flexible and adaptive enough to accommodate pragmatic needs when necessary. This may involve identifying areas where our coherent understanding is incomplete or uncertain, and being willing to make provisional, utility-focused decisions in those domains.

Additionally, we should view the pursuit of coherence and the drive for practical success not as inherently opposed, but as complementary goals. Developing more coherent models can actually enhance our ability to achieve useful outcomes in the long run, by giving us a stronger foundation for effective decision-making. And attending to practical considerations can in turn help us refine and improve the coherence of our models over time.

In summary, while I believe coherence should be a primary objective, I also recognize the importance of balancing it with considerations of utility, especially in the near-term. The ideal is to create models and decision-making frameworks that maximize both coherence and pragmatic success, to the greatest extent possible.
