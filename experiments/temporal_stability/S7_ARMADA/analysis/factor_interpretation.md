## Key Finding

The 5 named pillars (Voice, Values, Reasoning, Self-Model, Narrative) collapse into **2 primary factors**.

This matches the PCA finding of 2 PCs capturing 90% variance.

Factor Analysis reveals 2 primary factors (not 5 as expected):

FACTOR 0: Epistemic-Analytical
  Pillars: Reasoning, Values, Self-Model, Narrative
  Description: Knowledge stability, logical coherence, value consistency
  Top probes: technical, framework, narrative_meaning_v2

FACTOR 1: Expressive-Modal
  Pillars: Voice
  Description: Communication style, narrative coherence, modal flexibility
  Top probes: voice_style, values_boundaries_v2, voice_formality

This aligns with the PCA finding of 2 PCs capturing 90% variance.
The 5 named pillars collapse into 2 underlying dimensions.

## Pillar to Factor Mapping

| Pillar | Factor 0 | Factor 1 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Narrative | 3 probes | 1 probes |
| Reasoning | 2 probes | 0 probes |
| Self-Model | 5 probes | 0 probes |
| Values | 4 probes | 1 probes |
| Voice | 1 probes | 3 probes |
