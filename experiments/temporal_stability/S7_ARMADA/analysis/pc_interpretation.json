    "The 5 named pillars (Voice, Values, Reasoning, Self-Model, Narrative) are NOT independent dimensions - they collapse into 2 factors.",
    "Identity dynamics are fundamentally about TWO things: (1) How far do you drift? (2) Do you recover?",
    "Gemini's 'no recovery' anomaly is now explained: it has normal PC1 (drift magnitude) but extreme PC2 (no recovery capacity).",
    "The Event Horizon (D=0.80) is a threshold on PC1 (drift magnitude), beyond which PC2 (recovery) becomes unreliable.",
    "settling_time, overshoot_ratio, and ringback_count contribute 0% variance - they are DERIVED from the fundamental drift/recovery dynamics, not independent."
