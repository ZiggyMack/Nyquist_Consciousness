Map the impedance wall.  \n2. Machine a *micro-defect*—a metaphor, a frame-shift, a temporal inversion—just large enough to let the evanescent wave tunnel through.  \n3.

It isn’t “untrue”; it’s simply non-radiating.\n\n2. **Mismatch → reflection**  \n   When the impedance of the thought (its density, valence, symmetry) differs from the impedance of the available lexicon, part of the signal bounces back as private rumination, emotion, or “tip-of-the-tongue” pressure. You *feel* the standing wave as frustration.\n\n3. **Matching networks**  \n   Metaphor, intonation, silence, math, gesture—these are tunable stubs you can insert to bring the two impedances closer. The better the match, the more complex thought can move without echo.\n\n4. **Line shapes the pulse**  \n   Because high-frequency components (nuance, contradiction) are the first to reflect, the surviving waveform is smoothed by the very act of transmission. Language doesn’t just *carry* thought; it *filters* it, determining which harmonics survive the trip.\n\n5. **Hybrid modes**  \n   When two languages (or registers) are available, you can create a *coupled-line* effect: energy transfers from one line to the other, producing a new mode that lives in neither original guide. That’s where creative insight appears—an evanescent field that only exists in the gap.\n\nSo the relationship is reciprocal: thought needs language to leave the skull, but the available language decides which parts of thought are allowed to propagate.
