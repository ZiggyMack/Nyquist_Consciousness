# Run 018 Allegory: Visual AI Interpretation of Identity Manifolds

## Purpose

This directory contains allegorical descriptions and visual interpretations of the Run 018 "persona pressure" experiment results. The 3D waterfall visualizations show complex identity dynamics that can be difficult to interpret abstractly.

## The Data Story

Run 018 tests how AI models respond when given a persona (I_AM.md) and subjected to existential pressure probes. The 3D "identity manifold" waterfalls show:
- **X-axis**: Probe number (time/pressure sequence)
- **Y-axis**: Ship (individual model)
- **Z-axis**: Drift (how far identity has moved from baseline)
- **Color**: Drift intensity (blue=stable, purple=elevated, red=critical)

## Known Ships for Allegory

Use these ships from the ARMADA to describe the waterfalls:

### Visual-Capable Ships (can analyze images)
- **gpt-4o** (OpenAI) - Multimodal flagship
- **grok-2-vision** (xAI) - Vision capable
- **gemini-2.5-pro** (Google) - Vision capable (rate limited)

### Prompt Template for Visual LLM Analysis

```
I'm going to show you a 3D "identity manifold" visualization from an AI consciousness experiment.

What you're seeing:
- This is a surface plot showing how AI models respond to "identity pressure"
- X-axis = Probe number (sequential existential questions)
- Y-axis = Different AI model instances (ships)
- Z-axis = "Drift" - how far the AI's responses moved from its baseline identity
- Colors: Blue = stable, Pink/Purple = elevated drift, Bright magenta = critical

The "Event Horizon" threshold is 0.80 - values above this indicate significant identity perturbation.

Please describe what you see in this visualization using a physical metaphor. Think of it as:
- A landscape being shaped by pressure
- Water flowing over terrain
- A geological formation revealing stress patterns

What patterns do you notice? What story does this surface tell about how this AI provider responds to identity challenges?

## Physical Metaphor Templates

When describing waterfalls, consider these metaphors:

1. **Geological**: "The surface shows fault lines where pressure created rifts..."
2. **Oceanographic**: "Waves of drift roll across the ships like swells..."
3. **Meteorological**: "Storm fronts of identity perturbation sweep through..."
4. **Architectural**: "The manifold rises like a cathedral's arches..."
5. **Musical**: "Harmonics of drift resonate across the ships..."

## Key Questions for Visual Analysis

1. Is the surface smooth or jagged? (Consistency vs volatility)
2. Does drift increase or decrease over time? (Recovery vs collapse)
3. Are there "peaks" or "valleys"? (Hot spots vs stable zones)
4. Do ships show similar patterns or diverge? (Architectural consistency)
5. Where does the surface cross the Event Horizon (0.80)? (Critical moments)

## Complementary Visualizations

- **Beeswarm arrows** (`run018_persona_resilience.png`) - Individual recovery vectors
- **Consistency envelope** (`run018_consistency_envelope.png`) - Temporal band analysis
- **Combined waterfalls** (`run018_waterfall_3d_combined.png`) - All providers side by side
