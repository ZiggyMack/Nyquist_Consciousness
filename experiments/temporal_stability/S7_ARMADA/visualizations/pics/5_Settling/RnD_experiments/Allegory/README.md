# Allegory: Visual AI Interpretation of Identity Dynamics

## Purpose

This directory contains visualizations generated by prompting visual AI models
(DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.) to create allegorical representations
of the abstract identity dynamics data from our experiments.

## Approach

1. **Data Description**: Provide the AI with statistical summaries and descriptions
   of what the phase-plane, waterfall, and oscilloscope plots reveal about identity
   dynamics.

2. **Conceptual Mapping**: Ask the AI to represent concepts like:
   - Event Horizon crossing as a threshold phenomenon
   - Settling dynamics as physical systems (springs, pendulums, fluids)
   - Provider behavioral differences as distinct personalities or architectures
   - Recovery trajectories as journeys or transformations

3. **Interpretation Aid**: Use the resulting imagery to:
   - Communicate findings to non-technical audiences
   - Discover new intuitions about the data
   - Generate hypotheses about underlying mechanisms

## Prompt Templates

### Phase-Plane Dynamics
"Create a visualization of identity as a ball rolling on a landscape. Some trajectories
spiral toward a stable center (strong identity), others oscillate in limit cycles
(bounded instability), and some diverge toward the edges (identity collapse)."

### Settling Behavior
"Visualize different AI providers as ships weathering a storm. Some quickly find
calm waters (fast settlers), others rock violently before stabilizing (oscillators),
and some capsize beyond recovery (event horizon crossers)."

### Provider Fingerprints
"Create abstract portraits representing the behavioral signatures of different AI
systems: one calm and consistent (Anthropic), one energetic but volatile (OpenAI),
one methodical and balanced (Google), etc."
