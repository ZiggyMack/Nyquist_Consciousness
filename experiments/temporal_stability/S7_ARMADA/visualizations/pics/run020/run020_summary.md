## Key Findings

### 020A Tribunal
- Prosecutor and Defense phases show distinct drift dynamics
- Cross-provider replication achieved (OpenAI, Together at IRON CLAD)

### 020B Inherent vs Induced
- Control arms show ~31-51% of treatment drift
- Confirms 82% inherent drift finding from Run 018
- "Thermometer analogy": measurement reveals, doesn't create
