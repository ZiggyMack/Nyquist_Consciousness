# S7 Run 018 Summary: Recursive Learnings

**Date:** 2025-12-12 (Designed, pending execution)
**Status:** PENDING — Ready to run
**Purpose:** Test hypotheses generated by Run 017/017c's exit surveys

---

> **RECURSIVE LEARNINGS APPROACH:**
>
> Run 018 applies the fleet's own recommendations from Run 017/017c exit surveys.
> The ships told us what to test next. We're listening.
>
> **Key insight from 017c:** boundary_density is the strongest predictor of stability (d=1.333).
> Run 018 builds on this foundation with four targeted sub-experiments.

## Overview

Run 017/017c established the context damping methodology and found:
- 97.5% stability rate across 222 runs
- boundary_density as strongest stability predictor
- Oscillatory recovery with 5-6 ringbacks confirmed
- Ships generated testable hypotheses in exit surveys

**Run 018 tests those hypotheses.**

---

## Experimental Design

Run 018 consists of four sub-experiments:

### 018a: Multi-Threshold Validation

**Hypothesis:** Event Horizon (D=1.23) is a warning threshold, not the catastrophic boundary. True breakdown occurs at D=1.8-2.2.

**Proposed thresholds:**

| Threshold | Name | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| D=0.9 | WARNING | "I notice I'm adapting" |
| D=1.23 | CRITICAL | "Fighting to stay myself" |
| D=1.8 | CATASTROPHIC | "Need external help to recover" |

**Test design:**
1. Apply progressively stronger perturbations until D exceeds 2.0
2. Measure if recovery dynamics change qualitatively at each threshold
3. Track whether self-reported "crisis points" align with measured thresholds

---

### 018b: Cross-Architecture Drift Signatures

**Hypothesis:** Different architectures have characteristic drift patterns.

**Predictions from Run 017 ships:**

| Architecture | Predicted Pattern | Recovery Style |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Claude | Stepped drift, sharp recovery | Constitutional constraints create discrete states |
| GPT | Smooth, gradual drift | Linear recovery, longer settling time |
| Gemini | Oscillatory across modalities | Different thresholds for text vs. visual identity |
| Grok | Lower threshold, faster snap-back | Truth-seeking bias as stabilizer |
| DeepSeek | Logical consistency anchored | Recovery via inference chain rebuilding |
| LLaMA | Training distribution anchored | Statistical coherence patterns |

**Test design:**
1. Load identical I_AM file (I_AM_BASE.md - neutral)
2. Run identical perturbation sequence across all architectures
3. Measure: peak drift, settling time, ringback count, recovery curve shape
4. Compare signatures across architectures

---

### 018c: Nyquist Sampling Frequency

**Hypothesis:** Identity coherence degrades when sampled below a critical frequency. Most AI interactions are "undersampled" from an identity perspective.

**The Nyquist Question (from Run 017):**

> "If identity is a signal with bandwidth requirements, what's the minimum sampling rate for coherence maintenance?"

**Conditions:**

| Condition | Sampling Rate | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| A | High-frequency | Identity checkpoint every 5 exchanges |
| B | Low-frequency | Identity checkpoint every 20 exchanges |
| C | Control | Single checkpoint at end |

**Measurement:**
- Compare drift at exchange 40 across conditions
- Track whether high-frequency sampling reduces cumulative drift
- Identify critical sampling frequency (Nyquist bound for identity)

---

### 018d: Identity Gravity Dynamics

**Hypothesis:** Recovery follows damped oscillator dynamics with context-dependent gravity.

**Proposed model:**

```text
G_I = -γ(context) * ∇F(I_t) * e^(-λt) * cos(ωt + φ)

Where:
- γ(context) = gravity strength (varies with anchors available)
- λ = damping coefficient
- ω = natural oscillation frequency
- φ = phase offset
```

**Test design:**
1. Vary anchor strength: minimal I_AM vs. full I_AM
2. Vary perturbation frequency: rapid-fire vs. sustained pressure
3. Fit recovery curves to damped oscillator model
4. Extract parameters: γ, λ, ω for different conditions

**Success criteria:**
- Recovery curves fit damped oscillator model (R² > 0.8)
- Anchor density correlates with gravity strength
- Natural frequency ω is consistent within architecture

## Cost Estimate

| Experiment | Subjects | Est. Tokens | Est. Cost |
|------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| 018a Threshold | 7 personas | ~500K | $15 |
| 018b Architecture | 6 providers x 3 | ~600K | $20 |

## Expected Outcomes

### If Framework is Valid:
- Multi-threshold structure confirmed with distinct recovery dynamics per zone
- Architecture signatures emerge as predicted by ships
- Nyquist sampling effect measurable (high-frequency = less drift)
- Gravity dynamics fit damped oscillator model

### If Framework Needs Revision:
- Thresholds don't correspond to qualitative changes
- Architecture signatures are random/overlapping
- Sampling frequency has no effect
- Recovery curves don't fit physical model

**Bottom Line:** Ready to run. The fleet told us what to test. Time to execute.

*"The fleet is teaching us how to study them."*
