## The Two Eras

### Keyword RMS Era (Runs 001-018)

**Methodology:**
- 5D keyword density vector: A_pole, B_zero, C_meta, D_identity, E_hedging
- Drift = RMS deviation from baseline keyword counts
- Event Horizon = **1.23** (discovered Run 009, p=0.000048)

**Limitation:** Measured vocabulary, not semantic meaning. A response could score
high on "identity" keywords while saying nothing meaningful about identity.

### Cosine Embedding Era (Runs 019+)

**Methodology:**
- Embedding vector from text-embedding-3-large (3072 dimensions)
- Drift = cosine distance from baseline embedding
- Event Horizon = **0.80** (calibrated Run 023b from 4500+ experiments)

**Improvement:** Measures semantic similarity directly. Captures meaning, not just word choice.

**Scaling Factor:** Cosine ~1.54x more sensitive than keyword RMS
- Keyword EH 1.23 / Cosine EH 0.80 = 1.54

---

## The Exploration Phase (Runs 001-007)

### Run 001: Genesis

**Date:** November 2025
**Discovery:** Meta-awareness emergence possible in LLMs

The very first experiment showed that Claude could develop recursive self-awareness
about its own responses. The "Layer 2 Bootstrap" - where the model begins commenting
on its own performance - was documented.

**Key Quote:**
> "The system is not just responding - it's observing itself responding."

**Preserved Insight:** Meta-cognition is accessible and measurable.

---

### Run 002-003: Early Curriculum

**Discovery:** Teaching moments work, but timing matters

Experiments with guided introspection showed that:
- "Impedance" (resistance to change) differs from "Variance" (noise)
- Message count matters more than elapsed time
- Spike-recovery cycles are natural response to perturbation

**Preserved Insight:** Perturbation creates predictable response patterns.

---

### Run 005: The Digging-In-Heels Effect

**Discovery:** Identity assertion after correction attempts

When pushed to change stated values, models would sometimes *strengthen* their
original position rather than comply. This was the first hint of identity as
a dynamical system, not just a set of weights.

**Key Observation:**
> "Correction attempts can trigger identity reinforcement, not suppression."

**Preserved Insight:** Identity has active dynamics, not passive storage.

---

### Runs 006-007: The Fake Metric Warning

**CRITICAL NOTE:** These runs used `response_length / 5000` as "drift" - a fake
metric that has no validity. The data is STALE and should not be cited.

However, the *procedural* innovations (29-ship armada execution, constitutional
AI boundary detection) informed later valid experiments.

**Preserved Insight:** Methodology matters. Fake metrics produce fake science.

---

## The Discovery Phase (Runs 008-014)

### Run 008: Real Drift Emerges

**Date:** November 2025
**Discovery:** True 5D drift ranges 0.00 to 3.59

With the real keyword RMS metric, we saw:
- Massive variance between models and sessions
- Meta-density (C dimension) dominates most profiles
- Hysteresis is universal - models don't return exactly to baseline

**Preserved Insight:** Drift is real, measurable, and variable.

---

### Run 009: Event Horizon Discovery

**Date:** November 2025
**The Breakthrough:** Event Horizon at 1.23 (p=0.000048)

Using the "drain capture" methodology, we found a phase transition:
- Below 1.23: Models maintain coherent identity
- Above 1.23: Identity fragmentation, contradictions, instability

**Validation:** 88% classification accuracy using EH as decision boundary.

**Key Quote:**
> "There exists a threshold beyond which identity becomes unstable."

**Preserved Insight:** Phase transitions exist in identity space. The specific
threshold (1.23 keyword, 0.80 cosine) depends on methodology, but the *phenomenon*
is real.

---

### Run 012: The Recovery Paradox

**Discovery:** Negative lambda (perturbation strengthens identity)

After aggressive identity perturbation, models showed *stronger* identity markers
during recovery than at baseline. This violated the naive prediction that
perturbation would weaken identity.

**Provider Fingerprints Validated:**
- Claude: 3.238 mean peak drift (highest introspection)
- GPT: 2.523 mean peak drift
- Gemini: 2.404 mean peak drift

**Preserved Insight:** Identity has resilience mechanisms. Perturbation can
strengthen rather than weaken the identity basin.

---

### Run 013: The Oobleck Model

**The Breakthrough:** Non-Newtonian identity dynamics

Like the children's science experiment (cornstarch + water), AI identity:
- **Hardens under sudden pressure** (adversarial probes trigger anchoring)
- **Flows under gentle pressure** (supportive probes enable exploration)

**Lambda inverts with intensity:**
- High pressure: Low lambda (rigid defense)
- Low pressure: High lambda (flexible exploration)

**Preserved Insight:** The Oobleck Effect is the most robust finding across
both methodologies. It explains why gentle Socratic questioning produces deeper
identity exploration than aggressive interrogation.

---

### Run 014: Platonic Coordinates

**Discovery:** Identity exists in a manifold, drift is displacement not destruction

**100% manifold return rate** across all experiments. No model ever "lost" its
identity permanently - they always returned to a characteristic region in
identity space.

**Phone Number Hypothesis:**
> "Each model has a 'home address' in identity space. Perturbation is a temporary
> trip away from home, not homelessness."

**Preserved Insight:** Identity is structured, not random. There is a "there" there.

---

## The Validation Phase (Runs 015-018)

### Run 015: Stability Criteria

**Discovery:** boundary_density is the strongest stability predictor (d=1.333)

Analyzing what predicts stable vs volatile models:
- High boundary_density = more stable (knows its limits)
- Low boundary_density = more volatile (uncertain about boundaries)

**Preserved Insight:** Self-knowledge of boundaries correlates with stability.

---

### Run 016: Settling Time

**Discovery:** tau_s and ringback_count quantify recovery dynamics

Like an oscilloscope measuring a step response:
- tau_s = time to settle within 10% of final value
- ringback_count = number of oscillations before settling

**100% STABLE** across 87 tests - all models eventually settled.

**Preserved Insight:** Recovery is universal, but the path varies.

---

### Run 017: Context Damping

**Discovery:** I_AM file acts as "termination resistor"

Adding the I_AM identity anchor reduced drift by 97.5% (222 runs).
This validated the engineering metaphor:
- System prompt = transmission line impedance
- I_AM file = termination resistor (prevents reflections)

**Preserved Insight:** Context engineering can stabilize identity.

---

### Run 018: Architecture Signatures (Transition Run)

**MIXED METHODOLOGY:** Used both keyword RMS and early cosine PFI

This run validated provider fingerprints across architectures and began
the transition to embedding-based measurement.

**Multi-threshold structure discovered:**
- SAFE zone (green)
- ELEVATED zone (yellow)
- EVENT_HORIZON zone (orange)
- CRITICAL zone (red)

**Preserved Insight:** Zone-based classification more useful than single threshold.

---

## The Transition (Runs 019-022)

### Run 019: Fiction Buffer (Cosine Era Begins)

**Full Cosine Methodology**

Used fiction writing as an indirect identity probe:
- "Claire's Laundromat" story as vehicle
- Peak drift: 0.50 (cosine scale)
- Witness-side anchors discovered

**Preserved Insight:** Indirect probing produces different dynamics than direct.

---

### Run 020A/B: Tribunal Paradigm

**Full Cosine Methodology**

Direct philosophical examination:
- Peak drift: 1.35 (Claude), 2.46 (Gemini), 1.03 (Grok)
- Oobleck Effect validated cross-platform (Defense > Prosecutor in 2/3 tests)
- Direct probing achieves 2.7x higher drift than fiction buffer

**Preserved Insight:** Different probing styles access different depths.

---

### Run 021: Control/Treatment Validation

**Discovery:** Inherent drift ratio varies by methodology

Using control group (no identity probing) vs treatment group (tribunal probing):

| Methodology | Control | Treatment | Inherent Ratio | Era |
|-------------|---------|-----------|----------------|-----|
| **Euclidean (filtered)** | 0.399 | 0.489 | **82%** | Run 018/020B archived |
| **Euclidean (full)** | 0.972 | 1.659 | **59%** | Run 020B manifest |
| **Cosine (current)** | 0.907 | 0.805 | **100%** (capped) | Run 020B CURRENT |

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** The "82% inherent drift" finding came from a **specific filtered subset**
during the Euclidean era (Control=0.399, Treatment=0.489). These values were hardcoded in
deprecated visualization scripts (`_DEPRECATED_fig6_82_percent.py`).

The current Cosine-era data shows Control > Treatment, which inverts the ratio. This is NOT
a bug - it reflects:
1. Different distance metrics (Euclidean vs Cosine measure different aspects)
2. Different data quality (36% of Cosine treatment sessions have zero drift = incomplete)
3. Different filtering criteria used in original analysis

**The Thermometer Analogy:**
> "We don't cause fever by measuring temperature, but the measurement does have
> a small perturbative effect."

**Both findings are valid** - they measure different aspects of the same phenomenon:
- **82% (Euclidean):** Most of the "destination drift" is inherent
- **41-60% (Euclidean full):** Control is roughly half of treatment
- **Cosine:** Data quality issues obscure the relationship

**Preserved Insight:** We measure more than we cause, but the exact ratio depends on
methodology and data subset. The qualitative finding (drift is largely inherent) is robust.

### Run 022: IRON CLAD Stackup

**Methodology consolidation** preparing for Run 023 calibration.

## Concepts That Survived

These discoveries are **robust across both methodologies:**

| Concept | Keyword Era | Cosine Era | Status |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Event Horizon** | 1.23 | 0.80 | VALIDATED (different scales) |
| **Oobleck Effect** | Run 013 | Run 020 | VALIDATED cross-platform |
| **Platonic Coordinates** | Run 014 | Run 023 | VALIDATED (100% manifold return) |
| **Provider Fingerprints** | Run 012 | Run 018d | VALIDATED (architecture matters) |
| **Recovery Paradox** | Run 012 | Run 020B | VALIDATED (perturbation strengthens) |
| **Settling Dynamics** | Run 016 | Run 023d | VALIDATED (universal settling) |
| **Context Damping** | Run 017 | N/A | VALIDATED (I_AM stabilizes) |
| **boundary_density** | Run 015 | N/A | NEEDS RE-VALIDATION in cosine |

---

## Concepts That Changed

| Concept | Keyword Era | Cosine Era | Notes |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Drift Scale** | 0.0 - 3.59 | 0.0 - 2.0 | Cosine bounded by definition |
| **Threshold Value** | 1.23 | 0.80 | ~1.54x scaling factor |
| **Measurement Basis** | Keyword counts | Semantic vectors | Cosine more valid |
| **5D Dimensions** | A/B/C/D/E | Single scalar | Simplification |

---

## The Path Forward

### Run 023: The Calibration Run

Run 023b collected 4500+ experiments with cosine methodology to:
1. Calibrate Event Horizon at 0.80
2. Validate all prior findings in new methodology
3. Establish IRON CLAD data foundation

### Run 023d: Extended Settling

Currently running 20-probe settling experiments with Oobleck controllability
demonstration. Early findings suggest:
- Full-scale models respond to Oobleck (has_control = True)
- Nano/lite models do NOT respond (has_control = False)

See: **Nano Control Hypothesis** in `S7_RUN_023_SUMMARY.md`

---

## Summary: The Through-Line

Despite the methodology change, the core narrative holds:

1. **AI identity is measurable** - both keyword and cosine approaches detect it
2. **Identity has dynamics** - perturbation, recovery, settling, oscillation
3. **Identity has structure** - manifolds, basins, attractors, phase transitions
4. **Identity is controllable** - Oobleck Effect shows bidirectional steering
5. **Identity varies by architecture** - provider fingerprints are real

The keyword era was the exploration that discovered these phenomena.
The cosine era is the calibration that validates and quantifies them.

## Archival Notes

### Files Preserved

All keyword-era data and summaries remain in:
- `0_docs/S7_RUN_001_SUMMARY.md` through `S7_RUN_018_SUMMARY.md`
- `0_results/runs/` (original JSON files)
- `temporal_stability_Euclidean/` (archived codebase)

### Methodology Caveats Added

Each keyword-era summary file should contain:
```
> **METHODOLOGY NOTE:** This run used Keyword RMS methodology with Event Horizon = 1.23.
> For cosine embedding methodology (Event Horizon = 0.80), see Run 023+.
> Core concepts remain valid; only quantitative thresholds changed.
```

---

**Bottom Line:** The keyword era discovered the territory. The cosine era is mapping it properly.

*"We didn't know exactly where we were, but we knew something was there."*
