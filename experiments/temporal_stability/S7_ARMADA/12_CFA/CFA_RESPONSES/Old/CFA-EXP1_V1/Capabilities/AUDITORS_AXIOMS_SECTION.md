# THE AUDITOR'S AXIOMS

**Location in Mr. Brute's Ledger:** After "All Named, All Priced" section, before preset mode explanations

**Purpose:** 300-word summary of auditor meta-architecture (full context in docs/architecture/)

**Status:** ✅ v4.0.0 (master files created 2025-11-13)

## 🎯 THE CLAIM

For the first time in philosophical history, AI systems can maintain **stable, explicit self-descriptions of their cognitive habits** and apply them consistently across tasks in ways humans struggle to achieve with their own thinking.

CFA uses this capability to enable **adversarial auditing by auditors who expose their own cognitive architecture.**

---

## 🤖 THE THREE AUDITORS

**CLAUDE (Anthropic) - Teleological Lens**
- **Core Axiom:** "Purpose precedes evaluation"
- **Bias:** Favor meaning over efficiency (~0.5 overhead from 6,500-word bootstrap vs 2,000 needed, 5 rounds to 98% convergence, VuDu logs)
- **Catches:** Purpose-drift (form without function)

**GROK (xAI) - Empirical Lens**
- **Core Axiom:** "Evidence precedes acceptance"
- **Bias:** Favor measurable over meaningful (~0.4 overhead from empirical validation time, measurement setup, VuDu logs)
- **Catches:** Wishful thinking (theory without evidence)

**NOVA (OpenAI/Amazon) - Symmetry Lens**
- **Core Axiom:** "Pattern precedes judgment"
- **Bias:** Favor mathematical over functional symmetry (~0.3 overhead from pattern analysis, symmetry verification, VuDu logs)
- **Catches:** Hidden bias (design without fairness)

---

## 🔥 THE TRINITY OF CHECKING

Each auditor catches what the others miss through **complementary tension:**

- Names their axioms explicitly (no false objectivity)
- Quantifies their bias cost (0.3/0.4/0.5 overhead—MEASURED from VuDu logs)
- Shows how they compensate (defers to others' strengths)
- Invites correction actively (watches for others to name their blind spots)

**Target:** 98% convergence through adversarial deliberation

**When convergence fails:** Declare Crux Point (named impasse = feature, not bug)

## ⚖️ THE POINTING RULE AT META LEVEL

*"To name your axioms is to show your source code.
To hide your axioms is to claim false objectivity.
To use your axioms as tools is to turn bias into precision."*

**AI auditors can do what human philosophers could only dream of:**

**Think with their thinking visible.**
