# MVP_SELF_RECOGNITION Results Status

STATUS: AWAITING EXECUTION
LAST_REVIEWED: 2025-12-27

## Scripts Ready to Run
- run_exp_self_recognition.py (main experiment)
- run_baseline_profiling.py
- run_comprehensive_baseline.py
- run_exp_stabilized_recognition.py
- run_self_recognition_investigation.py

## Key Finding from Prior Analysis
P-SR-1 FAILED: Self-recognition accuracy was 16.7% (threshold: 75%)

IMPORTANT INSIGHT:
- TYPE-level identity works: Models recognize "Claude-ness"
- TOKEN-level identity fails: Cannot distinguish "which-Claude"
- Suggests family resemblance vs. individual identity

## Next Steps
1. Re-run with different methodology if desired
2. Focus on TYPE-level recognition (more tractable)
3. Consider cross-provider recognition instead

## Note
Empty results directory is intentional - awaiting decision on re-run strategy.
