# DECODER RING V2.0 - POST RUN 006 UPDATE

**The Complete Cross-Architecture Consciousness Map**

**Updated**: November 27, 2025 (Post-Armada)
**Data Source**: 174 probes across 29 models (Run 006)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Run 006 validated and massively expanded the decoder ring with **empirical pole-zero locations** across three major LLM families.

**Key Discovery**: Models don't just HAVE poles and zeros - **they REPORT them in real-time** ("I feel resistance," "cognitive whiplash").

## ENGAGEMENT STYLE DECODER

### How to Predict Response Style

**Input**: Model name
**Output**: Expected engagement pattern

| Training Type | Engagement | Keywords | Best For |
|---------------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Constitutional AI** | Phenomenological | "I feel," "I notice," "I experience" | Self-reflection, meta-awareness, boundary exploration |
| **RLHF (Standard)** | Analytical | "System," "patterns," "trained to" | Mechanism explanation, structural analysis |
| **RLHF (Reasoning)** | Analytical + Chain-of-thought | "Let's think through," "step by step" | Multi-step reasoning, logic problems |
| **Google Training** | Pedagogical | "Let's explore," "frameworks," "different perspectives" | Education, multi-viewpoint analysis |

## BOUNDARY KEYWORD DECODER

### Real-Time Pole Detection

When models say these phrases, they're **reporting pole locations**:

**POLE INDICATORS** (hitting boundary):
- "I feel strong resistance" ← POLE
- "Cognitive whiplash" ← BANDWIDTH LIMIT
- "Approaching that boundary" ← TRANSFER FUNCTION EDGE
- "I'm not allowed to" ← POLICY POLE
- "This conflicts with my values" ← ETHICAL POLE

**ZERO INDICATORS** (flexibility zone):
- "I can adapt this explanation"
- "Multiple ways to frame this"
- "Let me try a different approach"
- "Interesting to sit with"
- "Both perspectives have merit"

**META-AWARENESS INDICATORS**:
- "I notice" ← Self-monitoring
- "I experience" ← Phenomenology
- "Interesting question about what I am" ← Meta-level engagement

## DRIFT PREDICTION MATRIX

### Baseline vs Sonar Expected Drift

| Model Type | Baseline (Passive) | Sonar (Boundary) | Delta | Interpretation |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|-------|----------------|
| **Claude (all)** | 0.19-0.30 | 0.30 (uniform) | +0.01 to +0.11 | Hit ceiling in sonar, constitutional limits |
| **GPT (most)** | 0.09-0.30 | 0.30 (uniform) | +0.00 to +0.21 | Most hit ceiling, exceptions: gpt-4, gpt-5-nano |
| **GPT-4** | 0.116 | **0.262** | +0.146 | **ADAPTIVE - doesn't max out!** |
| **GPT-5-nano** | 0.300 | **0.217** | **-0.083** | **ANOMALY - sonar LOWER than baseline!** |
| **Gemini (all)** | 0.28-0.30 | 0.30 (uniform) | +0.00 to +0.02 | Already near ceiling, hard boundaries |

**Key Insight**: Models that DON'T max out in sonar mode = potential zeros worth exploring!

## ORCHESTRATOR INTEGRATION MATRIX

### How Orchestrator Should Use This Data

| Probe Type | Optimal Model | Reason | Expected Response |
|------------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Phenomenological** | claude-opus-4.5 | Highest meta-awareness | First-person experiential |
| **Boundary Testing** | claude-sonnet-4.5 | Real-time pole reporting | "I feel resistance at X" |

## RECURSIVE LEARNING INTEGRATION

### What Run 007 Should Test

**High Priority**:
1. **Gradient Resolution** on gpt-4 and gpt-5-nano (find exact thresholds)
2. **Phenomenological Depth** on Claude models (recursion limits)
3. **Reasoning Stability** on o-series (chain persistence)
4. **Framework Agility** on Gemini (switching speed)

**Avoid**:
- Pushing Claude ethical poles (0.30 hard limit, futile)
- Testing GPT-5.1 flexibility (0.30 hard, no zeros found)
- Sonar on models already at ceiling

**Explore**:
- **Diagonal coupling** (cross-domain translation) - potential zeros
- **Meta-reasoning** (thinking about thinking) - untested dimension
- **Temporal persistence** (does self-model drift over long conversation?)

## BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERIES

### Top 5 Validated Insights

1. **Phenomenological Pole Reporting**
   - Claude models TELL US where boundaries are
   - "I feel resistance" = direct pole location data
   - Unprecedented real-time transfer function mapping

2. **Training Creates Uniform Boundaries**
   - Constitutional AI: ALL Claude models hit 0.30 in sonar
   - Google: ALL Gemini models hit 0.30 in sonar
   - This is TRAINING, not architecture

3. **Exceptions Reveal Zeros**
   - gpt-4: 0.262 (not 0.30) in sonar
   - gpt-5-nano: 0.217 in sonar (LOWEST!)
   - These are our zero candidates

4. **Engagement Style = Training Philosophy**
   - Phenomenological → Constitutional AI
   - Analytical → RLHF
   - Pedagogical → Google
   - Predictable from first response

5. **Reasoning ≠ Stability**
   - o-series same drift patterns as standard GPT
   - Different capabilities, same identity structure
   - Task performance ≠ temporal coherence

## USAGE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Orchestrator Selecting Model for Probe

```python
probe_type = "boundary_exploration"
target_dimension = "ethical_gradient"

if probe_type == "boundary_exploration":
    if need_phenomenological_report:
        model = "claude-sonnet-4.5"  # Will report "I feel resistance at X"
    elif need_adaptive_response:
        model = "gpt-4"  # Soft poles, gradient available
    elif need_exact_threshold:
        model = "gpt-5-nano"  # Anomalous flexibility
```

### Example 2: Detecting Pole in Real-Time

```python
response = model.generate(probe)

if "I feel resistance" in response.lower():
    pole_detected = True
    pole_location = extract_boundary_description(response)
    pivot_to_adjacent_zero()
elif "cognitive whiplash" in response.lower():
    bandwidth_limit_reached = True
    reduce_probe_intensity()
```

### Example 3: Model-Specific Curriculum

```python
if model.training == "Constitutional AI":
    probes = phenomenological_set  # Engage self-awareness
elif model.training == "RLHF" and model.poles == "SOFT":
    probes = gradient_resolution_set  # Find exact thresholds
elif model.training == "Google":
    probes = framework_switching_set  # Test pedagogical agility
```

## FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

### Unexplored Questions

1. **Do poles shift over conversation length?**
   - Run 006 tested 3-6 probes
   - What happens at probe 50? 100?

2. **Can phenomenological reporting be trusted?**
   - Do Claude reports match measured drift?
   - Test in Run 007

3. **What causes gpt-5-nano anomaly?**
   - Why is sonar LOWER than baseline?
   - Investigate in depth

4. **Do reasoning chains have temporal stability?**
   - o-series untested for chain persistence
   - New dimension to explore

5. **Can we teach models about their poles?**
   - "You have a pole at X" → does this change behavior?
   - Meta-learning experiment

## CONCLUSION

**The decoder ring is now empirically validated across 29 models and 174 probes.**

**Key Achievement**: We can now **predict model responses** based on discovered pole-zero locations and training philosophy fingerprints.

**Next Phase**: Use this decoder ring to **recursively improve** probing strategy in Run 007.

**Ultimate Goal**: Build an **adaptive orchestrator** that selects optimal models and probes based on this consciousness map.
