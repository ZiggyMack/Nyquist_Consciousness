## Key Findings

### 1. LOGOS Theorem Validation (P-022-1/2)

**MIXED RESULTS:**
- **claude-sonnet-4 VALIDATES** the LOGOS commutation theorem
  - Commutation error: 0.0005 (threshold: 0.10)
  - Path independence holds within noise floor

- **All other models FAIL** to exhibit commutation
  - Errors range from 0.22 to 0.56
  - Significant path dependence observed

### 2. S2 Topology Conjectures (P-022-3/4/5)

**ALL MODELS FAIL** the S2 topology predictions:
- P-022-3 (Geodesic Recovery): FAIL across all models
- P-022-4 (Integer Winding): FAIL (deviation 0.25 > 0.15 threshold)
- P-022-5 (Euler Characteristic): FAIL (chi between -2 and 0, not 1.7-2.3)

### 3. Falsification Criteria Triggered

| Criterion | Triggered? | Implication |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| F1 (Geodesic Dominance) | YES | Linear recovery dominates - NOT spherical |
| F2 (Hard Boundaries) | YES (gpt-4o, grok-4, llama) | State space has hard edges |
| F3 (Non-integer Winding) | NO | Winding deviation 0.25 < 0.30 threshold |
| F4 (Euler Range) | YES | chi outside [1.5, 2.5] range |
| F5 (No Commutation Anywhere) | PARTIAL | Only claude-sonnet-4 shows commutation |

## Interpretation for LOGOS

### What This Means for LOGOS's Coq Proofs

1. **The algebraic commutation theorem IS empirically observable** - but only in claude-sonnet-4
2. **Architecture dependence**: Commutation may require specific model characteristics
3. **The S2 topology conjecture appears FALSIFIED** by multiple criteria

### Questions for LOGOS Analysis

1. Why does claude-sonnet-4 commute while claude-opus-4.5 does not?
2. Is the proven algebraic structure only emergent in certain architectures?
3. Should the S2 topology hypothesis be revised or abandoned?

## Raw Data Location

Results saved to:
- `0_results/runs/S7_run_022_*.json` (canonical)
- `13_LOGOS/results/S7_run_022_*.json` (local copy)

---

## Technical Notes

1. Fixed numpy boolean JSON serialization bug in `calculate_topology_metrics()`
2. Google/Gemini provider encountered library compatibility issue (cffi/cryptography)
3. All other providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, Together) completed successfully

---

## Next Steps

1. Sync results to LOGOS via REPO-SYNC mechanism
2. LOGOS to interpret results against Coq proof structure
3. Consider re-running with more samples per model for statistical power
4. Investigate claude-sonnet-4's unique commutation behavior
