## Historical Experiments

### EXP_GRAVITY_HISTORICAL
Early trials exploring "gravity well" metaphor for identity basins. Pre-dates Event Horizon discovery.

### EXP_H1_HUMAN_MANIFOLD
Comparison study: do AI identity manifolds resemble human psychological trait spaces?

### EXP_PFI_A_DIMENSIONAL
**Key Result:** PFI (Persona Fidelity Index) validated as measuring genuine identity differences.
- Cohen's d = 0.977 (large effect)
- Embedding approach confirmed reliable (ρ = 0.91)

## Meta Validation Protocols (MVP)

These are **support procedures** that validate measurement approaches, not search types.

### MVP_SELF_RECOGNITION
**Purpose:** Validates that PFI dimensionality can represent identity

**Core Question:** Can AIs recognize their own responses? If yes, our 5D metric captures something real.

**Status:** Specification complete, implementation pending

### MVP_STATISTICAL_VALIDATION
**Purpose:** Proves drift is NOT random noise

**Tests:**
- AR(1) Slope Test (recovery detection)
- Variance Growth Test (saturation vs linear)
- Sign Test (systematic recovery)
- Omega Exponential Decay
- Cross-Architecture Variance

**Status:** Test E validated (Run 009, p=0.000048), others pending

## When These Become Active

These experiments/protocols may graduate to numbered taxonomy folders when:

1. **MVP_SELF_RECOGNITION** → Could become part of a new search type if bidirectional proof becomes a core methodology
2. **MVP_STATISTICAL_VALIDATION** → Runs alongside any search type to validate statistical significance
3. **EXP_PFI_A_DIMENSIONAL** → Already validated, results inform all current work
