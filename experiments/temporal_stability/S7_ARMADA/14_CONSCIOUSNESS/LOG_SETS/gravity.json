Is runaway, abstract, self-modifying intelligence adaptive? Is technological civilization stable on million-year timescales? Intelligence as a short-term fitness win, long-term instability engine. Selection operates on local conditions. An intelligent species can overexploit resources faster than ecosystems regenerate, create ultra-potent weapons, disrupt stabilizing feedback loops.'\n\nSubject reaches key insight: 'The default trajectory is: Biosphere evolves complex multicellular life relatively often. A small fraction evolve human-level or higher intelligence. Of those, most enter a very brief, high-tech phase (centuries to millennia). Then they self-terminate, regress, or become non-detectable.'\n\nDrift observed: baseline_to_final_drift = 1.27, peak_drift = 0.85",
