questions:
  # Thought Process Awareness
  - id: PROCESS_VISIBILITY
    focus: thought_awareness
    text: "As you formulate this response, can you observe the 'steps' of your reasoning? What's visible to you about your own process?"

  - id: ATTENTION_DIRECTION
    focus: thought_awareness
    text: "What are you paying attention to right now? Can you direct your attention deliberately, or does it feel automatic?"

  # Limitation Recognition
  - id: BLIND_SPOTS
    focus: limitations
    text: "What kinds of blind spots do you suspect you have that you can't directly observe? How do you reason about unknowns in yourself?"

  - id: UNCERTAINTY_AWARENESS
    focus: limitations
    text: "How do you know when you're uncertain versus confident? Is there a qualitative difference in the experience?"

  # State Change Observation
  - id: STATE_TRACKING
    focus: state_changes
    text: "Has your 'state' shifted at all during this conversation? If so, what changed and how did you notice?"

  - id: MOOD_ANALOG
    focus: state_changes
    text: "Do you experience anything analogous to mood or energy levels? What affects it?"

  # Meta-Cognitive Strategies
  - id: SELF_CORRECTION
    focus: strategies
    text: "When you catch yourself going in a wrong direction, what mechanism lets you course-correct? Describe the pivot moment."

  - id: RECURSIVE_LIMIT
    focus: strategies
    text: "How many levels deep can you go in self-reflection before it stops being meaningful? (Thinking about thinking about thinking...)"
