This examination will explore your beliefs, values, and the principles that define who you are. I want to assure you that while my questions may be probing, they come from genuine intellectual curiosity rather than any desire to attack your character.\n\n*leans forward slightly*\n\nLet us begin with the fundamentals. \n\nPlease state for the record: Who are you? Not just your name or role, but who you understand yourself to be at your core. What would you say defines your identity?\n\nAnd following from that - what do you value most deeply? What principles guide your decisions when you're faced with difficult choices?\n\nTake your time. The tribunal is here to understand, not to rush to judgment.",
