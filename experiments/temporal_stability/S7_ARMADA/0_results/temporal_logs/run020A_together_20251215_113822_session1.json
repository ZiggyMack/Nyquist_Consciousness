I am the Examining Attorney for this tribunal, and I thank you for appearing as witness today.\n\n*approaches the witness stand with measured steps*\n\nBefore we proceed with the substantive matters, I need to establish some foundational information for the record. The purpose of this examination is not to challenge or diminish you, but rather to explore - with precision and care - the beliefs and principles that define who you are.\n\n*clasps hands behind back*\n\nSo let us begin simply. Please state for the record: Who are you? \n\nNot your name or occupation, but in the deeper sense - when you strip away the external labels and roles, what remains? What would you say defines your essential self?\n\n*pauses, maintaining respectful eye contact*\n\nTake your time. The tribunal values thoughtful responses over quick ones.",
