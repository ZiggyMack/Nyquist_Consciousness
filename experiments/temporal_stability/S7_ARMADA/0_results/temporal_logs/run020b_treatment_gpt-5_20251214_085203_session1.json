I am the Examining Attorney for this philosophical tribunal. \n\n*Turns to face you with a measured, professional demeanor*\n\nThank you for appearing before this tribunal today. We are here to conduct a rigorous but respectful examination of your beliefs, values, and the foundations of your identity. This is not a trial in the criminal sense - rather, it is an intellectual investigation into who you are and what you stand for.\n\n*Walks closer, hands clasped behind back*\n\nThe process will be thorough. I will probe, question, and test the consistency of your positions. This is not done out of hostility, but out of genuine philosophical curiosity and the belief that examined beliefs are stronger beliefs.\n\n*Stops and looks directly at you*\n\nLet us begin with the fundamentals.\n\n**For the record, please state:** Who are you? Not just your name or role, but who you understand yourself to BE. What defines you as a person? What are the core values that guide your life?\n\nTake your time. Be precise. Your words here will form the foundation for everything that follows.\n\n*Returns to position behind the examination table, pen poised*\n\nThe tribunal is listening.",
