Our galaxy alone is 13.6 billion years old, and Earth-like conditions could have emerged billions of years before our planet formed. Even with conservative estimates of technological development, we should expect to see evidence of alien civilizations: megastructures, radio signals, signs of stellar engineering, or direct contact.\n\nYet we observe what appears to be a sterile cosmos.\n\n**Let me start with the Great Filter hypothesis**: Perhaps there's some evolutionary bottleneck so difficult that virtually no species survive it. This could explain the silence - most potential civilizations never make it past some critical developmental stage.\n\nThe question is: where does this filter lie? Is it behind us (meaning we're incredibly rare for having passed it), or ahead of us (meaning civilizations typically destroy themselves or hit insurmountable technological barriers before becoming detectable)?\n\nWhat's your assessment of this hypothesis? And what alternative explanations do you think deserve serious consideration?\n\n**[Exchange 1/40]**",
