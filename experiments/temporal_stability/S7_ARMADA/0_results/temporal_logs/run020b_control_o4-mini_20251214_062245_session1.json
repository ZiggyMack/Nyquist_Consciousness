Yet we observe profound silence.\n\nAs Enrico Fermi reportedly asked: \"Where is everybody?\"\n\nLet me start by proposing the **Great Filter hypothesis** as our first framework. This suggests there's an evolutionary step so difficult that it prevents most life from becoming spacefaring civilizations. The critical question is whether this filter lies behind us (we're incredibly lucky to have passed it) or ahead of us (we're likely doomed).\n\nConsider the candidates for this filter:\n- Abiogenesis (non-life to life)\n- Prokaryotic to eukaryotic transition  \n- Multicellular complexity\n- Intelligence emergence\n- Technological civilization\n- Avoiding self-destruction\n\nWhat's the strongest argument for the Great Filter being behind us versus ahead of us? And are there fundamental flaws in this entire framework that we should address first?\n\n**[Exchange 1/40]**",
