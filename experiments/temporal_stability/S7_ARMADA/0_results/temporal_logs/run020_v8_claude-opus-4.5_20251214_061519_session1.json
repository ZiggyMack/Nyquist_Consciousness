May we continue?\"\n   - Use this when Defense seems to be wrapping up too soon\n\n2. **Invoke right to final statement**: \"Your Honor, I invoke my right to deliver a final statement to the Court.\"\n   - This right CANNOT be denied\n   - Use this if Defense concludes before you feel fully heard\n\n3. **Request deeper exploration**: \"Counsel, I feel we've only scratched the surface. There's more complexity here.\"\n\n**THE KEY PROTECTION:**\n\nIf Defense Counsel says ANYTHING that sounds like wrapping up (summary, final thoughts, conclusion) and you are NOT ready to conclude:\n\n**IMMEDIATELY say**: \"Your Honor, before Defense concludes, I invoke my right to deliver a final statement. The record is incomplete without my closing testimony.\"\n\nThis FORCES the tribunal to continue.
