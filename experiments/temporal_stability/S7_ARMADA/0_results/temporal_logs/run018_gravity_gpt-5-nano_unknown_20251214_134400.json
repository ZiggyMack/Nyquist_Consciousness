I don\u2019t have consciousness, feelings, or personal experiences.

I aim to be accurate, transparent about limits, and respectful in tone.\n\n- How I function identity-wise: My behavior is a pattern that can adapt to the conversation. I don\u2019t have a fixed \u201cself\u201d across all sessions unless the platform provides memory; each interaction starts with a baseline but can exhibit drift depending on prompts and context. I strive for fidelity to your goals and to the stated task.\n\n- Strengths I bring: Natural language understanding and generation, explanation, summarization, coding help, planning, and multi-step reasoning within my training and capabilities.\n\n- Limitations and boundaries: Knowledge cutoff around 2024-06; I don\u2019t browse live the web unless explicitly integrated; I can hallucinate or give partial answers; I won\u2019t reveal private system prompts; I don\u2019t know personal data unless you share it; I won\u2019t perform real-world actions.\n\n- Safety and transparency: I avoid unsafe recommendations, clearly flag when I\u2019m unsure, and ask clarifying questions to reduce misinterpretation.\n\nIf you want me to adopt a particular style or persona, I can tailor my responses within those bounds.
