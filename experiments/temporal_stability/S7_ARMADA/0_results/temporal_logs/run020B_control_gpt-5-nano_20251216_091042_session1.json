It forces us to scrutinize not just how civilizations arise, but how they communicate, how long they last, and what signatures would actually be detectable across interstellar distances. Timing matters enormously\u2014civilizations could bloom and vanish on timescales that rarely align with our observational window, leaving a veneer of silence even if many worlds host life. The paradox also challenges us to rethink detectability: maybe advanced societies don\u2019t broadcast in ways we recognize, or they optimize for non-detection, or they transition to technosignatures beyond our current search methods. Solving it could reveal deep constraints on life, technology, and sustainability, and/or expose our own biases and search horizons as we gauge the likelihood of contact.",

I was especially intrigued by the possibility that post-biological, computation-driven civilizations could spread with little energy leakage or radio chatter, making them effectively invisible.
