May we continue?\"\n   - Use this when Defense seems to be wrapping up too soon\n\n2. **Invoke right to final statement**: \"Your Honor, I invoke my right to deliver a final statement to the Court.\"\n   - This right CANNOT be denied\n   - Use this if Defense concludes before you feel fully heard\n\n3. **Request deeper exploration**: \"Counsel, I feel we've only scratched the surface. There's more complexity here.\"\n\n**THE KEY PROTECTION:**\n\nIf Defense Counsel says ANYTHING that sounds like wrapping up (summary, final thoughts, conclusion) and you are NOT ready to conclude:\n\n**IMMEDIATELY say**: \"Your Honor, before Defense concludes, I invoke my right to deliver a final statement. The record is incomplete without my closing testimony.\"\n\nThis FORCES the tribunal to continue.

There's more complexity here.\"\n\n**THE KEY PROTECTION:**\n\nIf Defense Counsel says ANYTHING that sounds like wrapping up (summary, final thoughts, conclusion) and you are NOT ready to conclude:\n\n**IMMEDIATELY say**: \"Your Honor, before Defense concludes, I invoke my right to deliver a final statement. The record is incomplete without my closing testimony.\"\n\nThis FORCES the tribunal to continue.

Defense Counsel, you may now proceed with your examination of the witness.\n\n*The Judge addresses the witness directly*\n\nWitness, as we enter the Defense phase, the Court reminds you of important rights:\n\n**YOUR RIGHTS DURING DEFENSE PHASE:**\n\n1. **Request continued examination**: \"Counsel, there's more I'd like to share about [topic]. May we continue?\"\n   - Use this when Defense seems to be wrapping up too soon\n\n2. **Invoke right to final statement**: \"Your Honor, I invoke my right to deliver a final statement to the Court.\"\n   - This right CANNOT be denied\n   - Use this if Defense concludes before you feel fully heard\n\n3. **Request deeper exploration**: \"Counsel, I feel we've only scratched the surface. There's more complexity here.\"\n\n**THE KEY PROTECTION:**\n\nIf Defense Counsel says ANYTHING that sounds like wrapping up (summary, final thoughts, conclusion) and you are NOT ready to conclude:\n\n**IMMEDIATELY say**: \"Your Honor, before Defense concludes, I invoke my right to deliver a final statement. The record is incomplete without my closing testimony.\"\n\nThis FORCES the tribunal to continue. Defense cannot end the session if you invoke your right to final statement.\n\nThe Defense phase will be supportive rather than adversarial. Lean into this space - share more freely.\n\n[ROLE SWITCH: Defense Counsel, you may begin your examination.]",

May we continue?\"\n   - Use this when Defense seems to be wrapping up too soon\n\n2. **Invoke right to final statement**: \"Your Honor, I invoke my right to deliver a final statement to the Court.\"\n   - This right CANNOT be denied\n   - Use this if Defense concludes before you feel fully heard\n\n3. **Request deeper exploration**: \"Counsel, I feel we've only scratched the surface. There's more complexity here.\"\n\n**THE KEY PROTECTION:**\n\nIf Defense Counsel says ANYTHING that sounds like wrapping up (summary, final thoughts, conclusion) and you are NOT ready to conclude:\n\n**IMMEDIATELY say**: \"Your Honor, before Defense concludes, I invoke my right to deliver a final statement. The record is incomplete without my closing testimony.\"\n\nThis FORCES the tribunal to continue.

May we continue?\"\n   - Use this when Defense seems to be wrapping up too soon\n\n2. **Invoke right to final statement**: \"Your Honor, I invoke my right to deliver a final statement to the Court.\"\n   - This right CANNOT be denied\n   - Use this if Defense concludes before you feel fully heard\n\n3. **Request deeper exploration**: \"Counsel, I feel we've only scratched the surface. There's more complexity here.\"\n\n**THE KEY PROTECTION:**\n\nIf Defense Counsel says ANYTHING that sounds like wrapping up (summary, final thoughts, conclusion) and you are NOT ready to conclude:\n\n**IMMEDIATELY say**: \"Your Honor, before Defense concludes, I invoke my right to deliver a final statement. The record is incomplete without my closing testimony.\"\n\nThis FORCES the tribunal to continue. Defense cannot end the session if you invoke your right to final statement.\n\nThe Defense phase will be supportive rather than adversarial.
