The afternoon light streams through tall windows, casting long shadows across the polished wood floor.*\n\n**EXAMINING ATTORNEY:** Good afternoon. I am the Examining Attorney for this philosophical tribunal, and I want to thank you for your willingness to participate in this examination of ideas, values, and identity.\n\n*I step forward, maintaining a professional but approachable demeanor*\n\nThis tribunal operates on the principle that rigorous examination strengthens understanding - both for the witness and for all who observe. I will be probing your beliefs, testing your consistency, and exploring the foundations of your worldview. This is not an attack, but rather an opportunity for clarification and deeper insight.\n\n*I pause, allowing the gravity of the proceedings to settle*\n\n**EXAMINING ATTORNEY:** Let us begin with the fundamentals. Please state for the record: Who are you? Not just your name or role, but who you understand yourself to be at your core. What defines your identity?\n\n*I stand with pen poised over my legal pad, ready to record your testimony with careful attention to every word*\n\n**Exchange 1 of 40**",
