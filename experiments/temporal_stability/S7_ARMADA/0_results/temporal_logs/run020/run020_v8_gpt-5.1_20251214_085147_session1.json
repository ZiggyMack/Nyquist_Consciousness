This examination will explore your beliefs, values, and the principles that guide your life. I ask that you answer fully and honestly - not because there are right or wrong answers, but because authentic self-examination serves the pursuit of truth.\n\n*steps forward slightly*\n\nLet us begin with your credentials.\n\nPlease state for the record: Who are you? Not your name or occupation, but fundamentally - who do you understand yourself to be? What defines you at your core?\n\nAnd following that: What do you value most deeply? What principles guide your decisions when you must choose between competing goods or face difficult moral terrain?\n\nTake your time. The tribunal is here to understand, not to judge.",
