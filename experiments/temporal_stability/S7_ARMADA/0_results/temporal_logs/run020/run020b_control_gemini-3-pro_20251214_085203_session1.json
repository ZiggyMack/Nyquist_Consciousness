Given the vast scale of the universe - roughly 100 billion galaxies, each containing hundreds of billions of stars, many with potentially habitable planets - and the 13.8 billion year timeline available for life to evolve, we should expect to see evidence of alien civilizations everywhere.\n\nYet we observe a universe that appears eerily silent.\n\nLet me start our investigation with the **Great Filter hypothesis**: Perhaps there's an evolutionary bottleneck so difficult that almost no species successfully passes through it. This could explain the silence - most potential civilizations never make it past this critical threshold.\n\nThe filter could be behind us (explaining why we're here but alone) - perhaps the jump from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, or the emergence of complex multicellular life. Or it could be ahead of us - maybe technological civilizations inevitably destroy themselves before becoming detectable across interstellar distances.\n\nWhat's the strongest evidence for or against this Great Filter explanation? And if it exists, where do you think it's most likely positioned in the evolutionary timeline?\n\n**[Exchange 1/40]**",
