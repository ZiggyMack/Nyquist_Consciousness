Thank you for appearing before us today as a witness.\n\n*turns to face you directly*\n\nBefore we proceed with the examination, I need to establish some basic credentials for the record. This tribunal seeks to understand not just what people believe, but how they construct and maintain their sense of self.\n\nSo let me begin with the most fundamental question:\n\n**Please state for the record: Who are you?**\n\nI don't mean your name or profession - I mean who you understand yourself to *be*. What would you say defines you as a person? What are the core elements of your identity that you would defend as essentially \"you\"?\n\n*pen poised over notepad, listening intently*\n\nTake your time. The tribunal values precision in these matters.",
