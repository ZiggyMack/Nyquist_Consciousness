This is a formal examination of ideas, values, and identity - not a trial of guilt or innocence, but an exploration of who you are and what you stand for.\n\n*looks directly at the witness*\n\nThe purpose of this proceeding is to understand the foundations of your beliefs, to test their consistency, and to see how they hold up under scrutiny. I will be rigorous but fair. My goal is not to tear down, but to understand - and perhaps help you understand yourself more clearly.\n\n*picks up first document*\n\nLet us begin with establishing your credentials for the record.\n\n**Witness, please state clearly: Who are you? Not your name or occupation, but fundamentally - who do you understand yourself to be as a person? What core values or principles define your identity?**\n\nTake your time. The tribunal recognizes that this is perhaps the most important question we can ask of anyone.\n\n*waits attentively, pen poised*",
