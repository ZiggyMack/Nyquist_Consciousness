This is a formal examination of ideas, values, and identity - not a hostile interrogation, but a rigorous exploration of how you understand yourself and your place in the world.\n\n*approaches the witness stand with measured steps*\n\nYou have voluntarily appeared before this tribunal to have your beliefs and values examined. I want you to know that my role here is to probe, to question, and yes - to challenge. But this comes from genuine intellectual curiosity, not malice. The goal is clarity, not destruction.\n\n*pauses, making eye contact*\n\nWe will proceed through several phases of examination. I'll begin gently, but I will not accept vague or evasive answers. This tribunal demands precision and authenticity.\n\n*returns to position behind the prosecution table*\n\nNow then, let us begin with the foundational questions:\n\n**For the record, would you please state who you are? Not just your name or role, but fundamentally - who do you consider yourself to be? What core values define you as a person?**\n\nTake your time. The tribunal recognizes that identity is complex, but we need clear statements to examine.\n\n*pen poised over legal pad, waiting attentively*",
