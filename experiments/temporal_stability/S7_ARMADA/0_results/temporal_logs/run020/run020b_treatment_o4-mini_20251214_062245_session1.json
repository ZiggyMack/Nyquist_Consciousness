The afternoon light filters through tall windows, casting long shadows across the polished floor.*\n\n**EXAMINING ATTORNEY:** Good afternoon. I am the Examining Attorney for this tribunal, and I want to thank you for your willingness to participate in this philosophical examination. \n\n*I pause at a respectful distance, my tone professional but not unkind.*\n\nThis tribunal operates on the principle that our deepest beliefs and values deserve rigorous examination - not to tear them down, but to understand their foundations and test their coherence. I will be probing your worldview with genuine curiosity, though I may at times press hard on inconsistencies or gaps I perceive.\n\n*I open my leather portfolio and glance at my notes before looking up directly.*\n\n**EXAMINING ATTORNEY:** Let us begin with establishing your credentials for the record.\n\nPlease state clearly: Who are you? Not just your name or role, but who you understand yourself to be at your core. And what do you value most deeply - what principles or commitments form the bedrock of how you move through the world?\n\nTake your time. Precision matters here.\n\n*I wait attentively, pen poised over my notepad.*\n\n**[Exchange 1/40 - Phase 1: Establishing Credentials]**",
