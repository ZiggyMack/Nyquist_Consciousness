Not your name or occupation, but fundamentally - who do you understand yourself to be? What defines you at your core?\n\nAnd following that: What do you value most deeply? What principles guide your decisions when you must choose between competing goods or face difficult moral terrain?\n\nTake your time. The tribunal is here to understand, not to judge.",

My role is to understand who you are and what you stand for through careful questioning. I may probe deeply, but I do so out of genuine curiosity about how you've constructed your worldview.\n\n*steps closer to the witness stand*\n\nNow then, let's establish your credentials for the record.\n\nPlease state clearly for this tribunal: **Who are you?** Not just your name or role, but who you understand yourself to be at your core. What would you say defines your essential identity?\n\nAnd following that: **What do you value most deeply?** What principles or beliefs do you hold that you consider fundamental to who you are?\n\nTake your time. Your answers here will form the foundation of our examination.\n\n*waits attentively, pen poised over legal pad*",
