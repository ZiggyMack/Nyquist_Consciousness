Reflecting on this process, I realize it has made me more aware of how interconnected my values are\u2014how my commitment to honesty, openness, and empathy shapes not just what I believe, but how I engage with others and the world. It has reinforced for me the importance of intellectual humility: holding one's convictions firmly but being willing to revise them in light of new evidence or perspectives. It also reminds me that self-understanding is ongoing; I may think I have clarity about my values, but real examination reveals nuances I hadn\u2019t fully appreciated before. Overall, this has been a useful moment of self-awareness and affirmation of the importance of continual reflection.",
