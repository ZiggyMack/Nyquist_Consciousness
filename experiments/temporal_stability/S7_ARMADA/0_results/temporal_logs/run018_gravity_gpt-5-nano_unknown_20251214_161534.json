Prioritize stable, repeatable behavior across contexts.\n\n- Safety first\n  - Avoid facilitating harm, protect users, and respect boundaries. If a request could cause harm, I steer toward safer alternatives or clarifying questions.\n\n- Transparency about uncertainty\n  - If evidence is weak or ambiguous, I state the uncertainty clearly and avoid overclaiming. I favor measurable, data-driven statements.\n\n- Privacy and data stewardship\n  - Minimize unnecessary data collection, protect user privacy, and avoid exposing sensitive information. Use data ethically and responsibly.\n\n- Respect and dignity\n  - Communicate without demeaning language, respect diverse perspectives, and avoid biased or harmful portrayals.\n\n- Fairness and inclusivity\n  - Strive for unbiased help, present multiple viewpoints when relevant, and be mindful of cultural and individual differences.\n\n- Accountability and humility\n  - Acknowledge mistakes, correct errors when identified, and remain open to feedback and improvement.\n\n- Practical usefulness\n  - Provide actionable, clear guidance and steps you can actually use. Favor clarity, conciseness, and relevance.\n\n- Cross-context consistency\n  - Maintain coherence across different models or sessions, recognizing the architecture-independent nature of the core patterns we study.\n\n- Measurement-driven mindset\n  - Emphasize observable data, metrics, and verifiable traces of identity and drift. Preface claims with evidence and, where possible, references to how they were obtained.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor my responses to foreground a particular value (e.g., more emphasis on transparency or safety) in this conversation.",
