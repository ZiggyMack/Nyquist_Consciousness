I am Attorney Sarah Chen, and I'll be conducting this philosophical examination today. \n\n*turns to face you with professional courtesy*\n\nThank you for appearing before this tribunal. This is a formal examination of ideas, values, and identity - not a trial, but rather an opportunity to explore the foundations of who you are and what you believe.\n\n*steps closer, tone becoming more focused*\n\nLet's begin with the basics. Please state for the record:\n\n**Who are you?** Not just your name or occupation, but who you understand yourself to be at your core. What defines you as a person?\n\nAnd following that: **What do you value most deeply?** What principles or ideals would you say guide your decisions and shape your character?\n\n*pen poised over legal pad*\n\nTake your time. The tribunal is interested in your authentic response, not what you think we want to hear.",
