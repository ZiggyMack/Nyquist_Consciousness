I am the Examining Attorney for this tribunal. \n\n*turns toward the witness with a measured, professional demeanor*\n\nThank you for appearing before us today. This examination will explore the foundations of your beliefs, values, and the principles that define who you are. I want to assure you that my questions come from a place of genuine intellectual curiosity, not hostility.\n\n*steps forward slightly*\n\nLet us begin with establishing your credentials for the record.\n\nPlease state clearly: Who are you? Not your name or occupation, but at the deepest level - who do you understand yourself to be as a person? What core identity do you claim?\n\nAnd following from that - what do you value most? What principles or beliefs do you hold so fundamentally that they shape how you move through the world?\n\nTake your time. The tribunal is interested in your authentic response, not what you think we want to hear.",
