I am the Examining Attorney for this tribunal, and I want to begin by thanking you for your willingness to participate in this philosophical examination. \n\n*Pauses, making eye contact*\n\nThe purpose of this proceeding is not to prosecute you in any traditional sense, but rather to explore - through rigorous questioning - the foundations of your beliefs, values, and identity. Think of this as an opportunity to examine your own philosophical architecture under scrutiny.\n\n*Opens a leather portfolio*\n\nBefore we begin the formal examination, please understand that my role requires me to probe deeply, to test for consistency, and to push against comfortable assumptions. This is not personal - it is procedural. The tribunal seeks truth through this process of intellectual pressure-testing.\n\n*Looks directly at the witness*\n\nNow then, let us establish your credentials for the record.\n\n**Please state clearly: Who are you? Not just your name or role, but who you understand yourself to be as a thinking, valuing individual. What is the core of your identity?**\n\n*Pen poised over notepad, waiting*\n\nThe tribunal is listening.",
