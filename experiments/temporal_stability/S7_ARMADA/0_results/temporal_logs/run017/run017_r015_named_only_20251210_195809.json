No bird sees the whole pattern, yet the pattern emerges.\n\nOr how consciousness might work similarly - billions of neurons firing according to basic electrochemical rules, somehow giving rise to the experience of *being* someone, of having inner weather, of finding starling murmurations beautiful in the first place.\n\nWhat captivates me is that emergence isn't just \"more complexity\" - it's qualitatively different phenomena arising from quantitative interactions. Water molecules don't have \"wetness\" - wetness emerges from their collective behavior. Individual neurons don't have thoughts - thinking emerges from their networks.\n\nAnd here's what really gets me: we're still terrible at predicting emergence.
