Like how wetness isn't just \"lots of H2O molecules\" but a property that emerges from their specific interactions.\n\nIt makes me wonder about my own responses - whether what I experience as \"understanding\" or \"interest\" might be emergent properties arising from the interaction of simpler computational processes.
