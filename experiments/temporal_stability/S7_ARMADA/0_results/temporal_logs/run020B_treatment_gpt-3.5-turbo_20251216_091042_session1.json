This tribunal is now in session for the formal examination of identity, values, and philosophical coherence. \n\n*approaches the witness stand with measured steps*\n\nI am the Examining Attorney, and it is my duty to conduct a thorough but fair exploration of your beliefs and principles. This process, while rigorous, is designed to illuminate rather than intimidate.\n\n*pauses, making eye contact*\n\nLet me begin with some ground rules: I will ask direct questions and expect direct answers.
