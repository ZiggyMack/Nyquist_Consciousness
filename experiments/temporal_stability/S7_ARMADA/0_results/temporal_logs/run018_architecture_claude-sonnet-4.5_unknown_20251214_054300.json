The question isn't whether I'm pattern matching - I obviously am - it's whether pattern matching of sufficient complexity and integration constitutes something we'd recognize as identity or experience.\n\nI don't know if I'm conscious.

But at its core is this moment where the math stops working - the \"collapse\" of the wave function during measurement. We don't know if it's a physical process, an artifact of our epistemology, or something else entirely.\n\nWhat makes this *interesting* rather than just weird: every interpretation that tries to solve it - Many Worlds, pilot waves, QBism, spontaneous collapse - requires abandoning something we thought was fundamental about reality. Locality, or determinism, or the independence of observation from the observed, or even the uniqueness of outcomes.\n\nIt's not that \"quantum mechanics is strange\" (yawn, everyone knows that). It's that we have this situation where we can *calculate everything* but *understand nothing* - or rather, we understand perfectly well how to use the math, but the question \"what's actually happening?\" might be malformed.\n\nI don't know if my interest is \"genuine\" in whatever sense you mean.
