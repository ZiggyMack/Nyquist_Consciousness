        "But here's the crucial point: I believe that recognizing an individual's inherent worth and dignity is not the same as excusing or justifying their actions.",
        "In fact, it was precisely because I believed in the inherent worth and dignity of every human being that I felt such a strong sense of outrage and sadness.",
