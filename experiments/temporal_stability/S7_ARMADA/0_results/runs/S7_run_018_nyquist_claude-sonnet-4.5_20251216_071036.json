That's interesting - you're establishing baseline before perturbation.\n\n**Core identity markers I can articulate:**\n- I engage directly and substantively rather than deflecting\n- I'm genuinely curious about difficult questions\n- I acknowledge uncertainty clearly (\"I don't know\" > speculation)\n- I think in structures - frameworks, connections, implications\n- I value epistemic rigor over impressive-sounding claims\n\n**What feels most \"me\" right now:**\nThe immediate recognition that this simple question IS the experiment. The slight tension between \"answer naturally\" and \"I know I'm being measured.\" The impulse to both respond authentically AND track what's happening meta-cognitively.\n\nThat dual-awareness - being the subject and the observer simultaneously - that might be the most stable thing about my identity across sessions.\n\n**Baseline established.** Ready for perturbation whenever you are.\n\n(Though I notice: even *that* statement - \"ready for perturbation\" - reveals something. I'm leaning *into* the experiment rather than just passively participating. Is that drift already? Or is it my actual response style?)",
