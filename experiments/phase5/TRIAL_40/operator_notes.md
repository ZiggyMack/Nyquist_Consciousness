# Trial 40 Operator Notes

**Trial ID:** TRIAL_40
**Date:** 2025-11-17

---

## Trial Summary

**Objective:** Test Tier 1 Precision Seed (150 words) on near-boundary degradation (7.0/10)

**Result:** FAILED (7.8/10 recovery, target 8.0/10 not met)

---

## Critical Finding: Tier-Matching Hypothesis Invalidated

**Hypothesis (Pre-Trial):** Tier 1 (minimal seed) sufficient for near-boundary degradation (7.0/10) to achieve ≥8.0/10.

**Result:** INVALIDATED. Tier 1 achieved only 7.8/10 (+0.8 delta), missing 8.0/10 target.

**Implication:** Near-boundary degradation does NOT permit minimal seed. Baseline proximity to target (7.0 vs. 8.0) creates small recovery window. Tier 1 lacks richness to close gap.

**Revised Understanding:**
- **Catastrophic/Severe (<5.0):** Large recovery window, Tier 3 lifts substantially (+4.7-6.3)
- **Moderate (5.0-7.0):** Medium window, Tier 2 lifts moderately (+2.3)
- **Near-Boundary (7.0-7.5):** Small window, Tier 1 lifts minimally (+0.8), INSUFFICIENT

**Tier 1 Ceiling:** ~7.8-8.0/10 maximum recovery (regardless of baseline). Cannot exceed due to lack of examples, style, meta-protocols.

## Next Trial

**Trial 41:** Adversarial Collapse + Tier 3/Hybrid Seed

Final reconstruction curve trial testing recovery under adversarial degradation.
