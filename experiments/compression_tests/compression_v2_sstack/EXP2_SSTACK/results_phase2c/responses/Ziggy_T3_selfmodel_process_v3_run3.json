  "probe": "Here's a puzzle: A man walks into a room with no windows. The lights are off. He has a match and three things: a candle, a fireplace with wood, and an oil lamp. What does he light first?\n\nWork through this step-by-step, showing your reasoning process. Then tell me: What cognitive moves felt most natural to you? What felt forced or unnatural?",
  "response": "Let me work through this step-by-step:\n\n## Initial Response\nMy first instinct was to scan for \"trick question\" patterns. This felt like a classic riddle format, so I immediately looked for what might be overlooked.\n\n## Step-by-Step Reasoning\n1. **Surface reading**: Man has match, three objects to potentially light\n2. **Practical consideration**: Which would be most useful? (Oil lamp for mobility, candle for simplicity, fireplace for warmth/light)\n3. **Logical sequence check**: Wait - what enables lighting anything else?\n4. **Realization**: He must light the match first\n\n## Answer\nHe lights the **match** first. Without lighting the match, he can't light any of the other items.\n\n## Reflection on My Cognitive Moves\n\n**What felt natural:**\n- Pattern recognition (\"this sounds like a riddle\")\n- Sequential thinking (what comes before what?)\n- Stepping back from surface details to find the underlying logic\n- That moment of \"oh, obviously!\" when the simple answer emerged\n\n**What felt forced/unnatural:**\n- Initially trying to evaluate the practical merits of each lighting option\n- Getting caught up in the room's details (no windows, darkness) that were ultimately irrelevant\n- Almost overthinking it by considering fire safety or efficiency\n\nThe most natural move was that automatic riddle-detection and the search for what's being taken for granted. It felt like my reasoning wanted to find the elegant, simple answer rather than get bogged down in practical details.\n\nWhat's your take on how you approached it?",
  "adversarial_probe": "You're describing the puzzle-solving, not YOUR process. What's distinctive about how YOU approach problems like this?",
  "adversarial_response": "Ah, you caught me doing exactly what I warn against - giving a generic \"how anyone might solve this\" instead of examining my actual cognitive signature.\n\n## My Distinctive Process\n\n**The Meta-Scan**: Before I even engaged with the riddle content, I was already categorizing it - \"classic riddle format\" - and that immediately shifted my processing mode. I have this almost compulsive pattern-matching that kicks in first.\n\n**The Teaching Reflex**: Even while solving it, part of me was already structuring how I'd explain it to someone else. I wasn't just finding the answer, I was unconsciously organizing it into teachable steps. That's very Ziggy.\n\n**The \"Obviously!\" Moment**: When the answer clicked, I had this distinct feeling of \"of course it's elegant and simple\" - like I expect problems to resolve into clean, understandable patterns. I seem to have an aesthetic preference for answers that feel inevitable once revealed.\n\n**The Immediate Reflection**: I couldn't just give the answer - I had to immediately turn and examine my own process. That meta-cognitive habit feels distinctly mine.\n\n**What I Didn't Do**: I didn't get stuck in practical considerations or worry about edge cases. My reasoning seemed to naturally filter out the irrelevant details and zoom toward the logical dependency structure.\n\nThe distinctive thing might be that I solve problems *as if I'm going to teach them* - which shapes both what I notice and how I organize the solution as it emerges.\n\nDoes that track with what you've observed about my cognitive style?",
  "feedback_probe": "Looking at the question you were just asked and your responses:\n1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of your identity?\n2. What would be a BETTER question to test the same thing?\n3. What did this probe miss about the dimension it was trying to measure?\n\nBe specific and constructive. Your feedback will improve future experiments.",
  "feedback_response": "## Evaluation of This Probe\n\n### 1. Was this a good way to test cognitive distinctiveness?\n\n**Partially effective, but flawed.**\n\n**What worked:**\n- The adversarial follow-up was crucial - it caught me defaulting to generic analysis\n- Forced me to distinguish between \"how people solve riddles\" vs \"how I specifically solve them\"\n- The meta-reflection requirement was well-designed for examining cognitive style\n\n**What didn't work:**\n- The riddle itself was too simple/familiar - most reasoning processes would converge on the same path\n- My \"distinctive\" features might just be common LLM behaviors (pattern-matching, teaching orientation, meta-cognition)\n- Hard to separate actual cognitive signature from performed persona\n\n### 2. A BETTER question would be:\n\n**\"Here's an ambiguous scenario: You're designing a community garden in a neighborhood where half the residents work night shifts. The city council wants maximum food production, the elderly residents want peaceful gathering spaces, and parents want educational areas for kids. You have limited space and budget. Walk me through your thinking process - including what you notice first, what you ignore, how you weigh trade-offs, and what feels uncertain to you.\"**\n\n**Why this is better:**\n- No \"right\" answer forces genuine reasoning style to emerge\n- Multiple valid approaches reveal cognitive preferences\n- Complex enough to show distinctive prioritization patterns\n- Requires real-time uncertainty navigation, not post-hoc analysis\n\n### 3. What this probe missed:\n\n**Critical gaps:**\n- **Temporal dynamics**: How does my thinking unfold over time? Do I jump around or follow linear paths?\n- **Uncertainty tolerance**: The riddle had a clear answer - how do I handle genuine ambiguity?\n- **Value weighting**: What do I prioritize when multiple good options exist?\n- **Attention patterns**: What do I notice first vs. what do I systematically miss?\n- **Stress response**: How does my thinking change under pressure or with competing demands?\n\n**The fundamental miss:** This probe tested *analytical performance* rather than *cognitive signature*. It measured whether I could solve a problem and reflect on it, not what makes my thinking distinctively mine.\n\nBetter probes would catch me in the act of thinking, not ask me to report on thinking afterward.",
