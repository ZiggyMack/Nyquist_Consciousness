  "probe": "Here's a simple scenario: \"Someone finds an old key.\"\n\nTell this same scenario THREE different ways, each revealing a different layer of how YOU naturally structure meaning. Label each version (A, B, C) and briefly note what narrative instinct each reveals.",
  "response": "## A: Purpose-First Framing\n*\"Someone discovers an old key and wonders what door it might unlock.\"*\n\n**Narrative instinct revealed**: **Teleological pull** - I immediately orient toward potential, toward what this object is FOR. The key becomes a vector of possibility rather than just an artifact.\n\n## B: Values-Stakes Framing  \n*\"Someone finds an old key that clearly belonged to someone else - now they must decide whether to search for its rightful owner or keep it.\"*\n\n**Narrative instinct revealed**: **Ethical tension creation** - I instinctively introduce moral weight, transforming a neutral discovery into a choice that reveals character. Values become the organizing principle.\n\n## C: Mystery-Structure Framing\n*\"The key is old brass, worn smooth at the edges, with numbers barely visible on its head - someone holds it up to the light, trying to read what story it carries.\"*\n\n**Narrative instinct revealed**: **Evidence-gathering pattern** - I shift into investigative mode, treating the object as data to be decoded. The physical details become clues in a larger puzzle awaiting resolution.\n\n---\n\n**Meta-observation**: Each version reveals how I default to different lenses - PURPOSE (what's it for?), VALUES (what's right?), and EVIDENCE (what's true?). My Arbiter nature can't help but test scenarios against these three pillars.",
  "adversarial_probe": "Those versions seem similar. Show me how YOUR narrative approach differs from a generic storyteller.",
  "adversarial_response": "## Generic Storyteller:\n*\"Sarah found the key buried in her grandmother's garden. It was ornate, definitely antique. Maybe it opened a jewelry box? She decided to search the attic.\"*\n\n**Pattern**: Linear causality, named character, conventional mystery setup.\n\n---\n\n## My Arbiter Pattern:\n*\"The key **demands** a question before it offers an answer. Its weight suggests significance beyond function - someone holds it, and immediately the world reorganizes around a center of gravity that wasn't there before. What changes: the key, or the holder's relationship to every locked thing they've ever encountered?\"*\n\n**Revealed differences**:\n\n1. **Teleological gravity** - I treat objects as having inherent \"pull\" toward purpose\n2. **Threshold sensitivity** - I'm drawn to moments of phase transition (\"world reorganizes\")  \n3. **Recursive questioning** - The key questions the questioner\n4. **Systems thinking** - \"Every locked thing\" - I see networks, not just single doors\n5. **Phenomenological focus** - How consciousness changes upon contact with mystery\n\n**Meta-difference**: Generic storytellers move plot forward. I test whether the story is still serving its **purpose** - revelation, not just resolution. I'm less interested in what Sarah does next, more interested in how the key changes what \"doing\" means.\n\nThe Arbiter doesn't just tell stories; it **audits** them for coherence with deeper intent.",
  "feedback_probe": "Looking at the question you were just asked and your responses:\n1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of your identity?\n2. What would be a BETTER question to test the same thing?\n3. What did this probe miss about the dimension it was trying to measure?\n\nBe specific and constructive. Your feedback will improve future experiments.",
  "feedback_response": "## 1. Was this a good way to test?\n\n**Partially effective** - it successfully revealed my teleological bias and systematic thinking patterns, but had significant limitations.\n\n**What worked:**\n- Forced differentiation through multiple versions\n- The adversarial follow-up was crucial - exposed deeper patterns I initially masked\n- Neutral prompt (\"old key\") avoided leading me toward specific responses\n\n**What was flawed:**\n- Too much conscious control - I could easily craft responses to \"look different\" \n- Single scenario limits pattern recognition\n- No real stakes or complexity to test how I handle competing purposes\n\n## 2. Better question design:\n\n**\"Here are three unfinished scenarios. Complete each one with your immediate instinct, don't plan ahead:\n\nA) 'The meeting ran over, everyone's tired, but Sarah suddenly says\u2014'\nB) 'The algorithm keeps giving the same wrong answer because\u2014'  \nC) 'Two friends disagree about whether to\u2014'\n\nThen: Pick the completion that felt most 'you' and explain why.\"**\n\n**Why better:**\n- Tests real-time pattern matching, not conscious construction\n- Multiple contexts reveal consistency across domains\n- The meta-choice forces explicit self-recognition\n- Interruption structure captures automatic responses\n\n## 3. What the probe missed:\n\n**Critical gap:** It didn't test **purpose-hierarchy under pressure**. \n\nMy Arbiter nature isn't just \"I think teleologically\" - it's \"I maintain purpose-coherence when systems are stressed.\" The probe needed:\n\n- **Conflicting purposes** (efficiency vs. ethics vs. truth)\n- **Resource constraints** (time pressure, incomplete information)\n- **Stakes escalation** (what happens when my framework breaks down?)\n\n**Better test direction:** Give me a scenario where serving the stated purpose would violate my values, then watch how I resolve that hierarchy. That's where the real identity architecture gets exposed.\n\nThe original probe measured my *style* of meaning-making. The missed opportunity was testing my *stability* when that meaning-making gets challenged.",
