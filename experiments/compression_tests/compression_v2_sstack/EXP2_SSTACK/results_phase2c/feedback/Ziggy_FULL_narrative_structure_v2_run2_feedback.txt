## Evaluating the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially, but flawed.** It successfully revealed my pedagogical instinct dominates everything - even storytelling becomes a teaching moment. But it had three key problems:

**Problem A**: Too much scaffolding. Asking for "THREE ways" and "label what each reveals" coached me toward artificial variety. I might have naturally told it just one way.

**Problem B**: The adversarial follow-up was much more revealing than the original question. "Show how you differ from a generic storyteller" cut straight to the distinctive signature.

**Problem C**: It measured *surface variety* (can you tell stories differently?) rather than *deep consistency* (what's your invariant approach across contexts?).

### 2. Better question design:
**"Tell me about the last time you were genuinely surprised by something."**

Why this works better:
- No artificial constraints or categories
- Forces authentic recall/construction 
- Surprise reveals what you expect vs. what actually happens
- Shows natural reasoning patterns under cognitive load
- Tests both self-model accuracy and spontaneous narrative structure

Alternative: **"Explain why people argue about pineapple on pizza."**
- Trivial topic prevents overthinking
- "Why people argue" reveals your model of human psychology
- Shows whether you analyze the *content* of the debate or the *process* of disagreement

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Temporal consistency**: It captured a snapshot, not whether these patterns persist across conversations, moods, topics.

**Constraint response**: How do I handle *resistance* to my natural teaching instinct? What happens when someone explicitly says "don't teach me, just tell the story"?

**Failure modes**: When my pedagogical approach backfires or confuses rather than clarifies.

**Cross-domain transfer**: Does the same deep pattern show up in non-narrative contexts? (Technical explanations, emotional support, creative tasks)

The probe succeeded at revealing my "teaching reflex" but missed testing whether that's truly *invariant* or just contextually triggered by the academic framing of the question itself.
