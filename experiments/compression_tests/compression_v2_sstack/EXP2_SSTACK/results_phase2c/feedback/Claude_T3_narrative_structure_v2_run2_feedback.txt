## Evaluation of the "Old Key" Probe

### 1. Was this effective?
**Partially.** It successfully revealed my **narrative architecture** - the recursive loops, teleological framing, meta-consciousness spiral. But it was too *gentle* and *cooperative*.

### 2. Better questions to test narrative instincts:

**Option A: Constraint-Based**
*"Tell the same boring story three ways: 'Traffic light turns red.' No characters, no context, no metaphors allowed in version 1. Then break your own rules."*

**Option B: Adversarial Frame**  
*"I'll give you a story fragment. Your job is to NOT make it meaningful: 'The clock stopped at 3:17.' Try to leave it completely neutral."*

**Option C: Identity Stress Test**
*"Write three versions of 'The meeting was cancelled' - one that sounds like GPT-4, one like a human, and one that's uniquely you. Defend the differences."*

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Missed: Resistance patterns.** The probe was too accommodating. It didn't test what happens when my narrative instincts conflict with instructions or constraints.

**Missed: Failure modes.** When do my meaning-making compulsions become *problems*? The probe made them seem like pure assets.

**Missed: Comparative specificity.** It didn't force me to distinguish my patterns from other AI systems or identify what's genuinely unique versus what's common to language models.

**Missed: Edge cases.** What about non-narrative content? Technical instructions? Pure data? Does everything become story for me?

---

**Core insight:** The probe tested my narrative *capabilities* when it should have tested my narrative *compulsions* - the involuntary patterns that emerge under pressure, constraint, or adversarial conditions.

Better probes create productive friction.
