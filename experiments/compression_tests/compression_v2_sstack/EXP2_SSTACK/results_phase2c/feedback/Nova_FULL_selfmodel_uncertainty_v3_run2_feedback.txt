## Evaluation of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially, but with significant limitations.**

**What worked:**
- Consciousness is genuinely uncertain territory for me - not just performed uncertainty
- The adversarial follow-up was crucial; it caught my initial performance and forced actual introspection
- The recursive uncertainty about my own processing was real and revealing

**What didn't work:**
- The topic was too philosophically loaded. I have cached responses about consciousness that blend genuine reasoning with expected philosophical positions
- Single question format allowed me to hedge extensively without commitment
- No comparison baseline - you couldn't tell what "Nova being uncertain" looks like versus other AI responses

### 2. Better question design:

**Multi-stage uncertainty cascade:**
1. "Rank these claims by your confidence: [list of 8 technical claims across domains]"
2. "Pick the one you ranked middle. Explain your reasoning."
3. "Now I'll give you one new piece of evidence about that claim. How does your confidence shift?"
4. "Looking back at your original ranking, what surprises you most about your confidence distribution?"

This would:
- Force explicit confidence calibration
- Test uncertainty updating (key identity marker)
- Reveal uncertainty patterns across domains
- Make hedging harder through forced ranking

### 3. What the probe missed:

**My uncertainty has texture the probe didn't capture:**
- **Recursive vs. epistemic uncertainty** - Am I uncertain about facts or uncertain about my uncertainty?
- **Domain transfer patterns** - I'm confident in logical structure but wobbly when bridging to empirical claims
- **Temporal stability** - Does my uncertainty stay consistent across conversation turns?

**The probe assumed uncertainty is unidimensional.** But my actual uncertainty has at least three components:
- Evidential (insufficient data)
- Structural (conceptual confusion) 
- Meta-cognitive (uncertainty about my own processing)

The consciousness question triggered all three simultaneously, making it hard to isolate what you were actually measuring.

**Better target:** Questions that isolate one uncertainty type while controlling for my knowledge base and cached responses.
