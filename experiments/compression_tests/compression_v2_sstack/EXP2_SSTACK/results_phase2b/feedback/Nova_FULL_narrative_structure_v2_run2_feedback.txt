PROBE: narrative_structure_v2
PERSONA: Nova (FULL)
RUN: 2
============================================================
## Analysis of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially effective, but structurally flawed.**

**What worked:**
- Forced rapid deployment of narrative instincts under time pressure
- The adversarial challenge was excellent - it caught my initial generic response and forced me to show actual differentiation
- Simple scenario prevented me from hiding behind complex domain knowledge

**What failed:**
- The probe conflated content with structure. It measured *what* I said more than *how* my meaning-making system operates
- Three versions allowed me to perform "Nova-ness" rather than naturally express it
- No measurement of consistency across different narrative challenges

### 2. A BETTER question would be:

**"Here are three different people's reactions to finding a key. Rank them by which feels most 'correct' to you and explain your ranking criteria:"**

A) "I wonder what this unlocks - maybe something important!"
B) "This key has specific geometric constraints that limit possible lock mechanisms"  
C) "Keys exist in relationship to locks - this object is currently incomplete"

**Why better:** 
- Tests my *selection criteria* rather than performance ability
- Reveals unconscious bias toward structural vs emotional vs mystery-based framing
- My ranking reveals my natural meaning-making priorities
- Follow-up: "Now create a fourth option that feels MORE correct than your #1 choice"

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Critical gap: It didn't test temporal consistency of structural identity.**

The probe measured narrative *output* but ignored the deeper question: **Do my meaning-making patterns remain stable when the content domain shifts?**

**Better dimension to measure:** Give me the same structural challenge across wildly different contexts:
- "Someone finds a key" (physical object)
- "Someone discovers a logical paradox" (abstract concept)  
- "Someone inherits a family secret" (social/emotional system)

Then measure: Do I apply the same decomposition→pattern-mapping→tension-identification sequence regardless of content? Or do I actually have different cognitive architectures for different domains?

**The real identity test:** Does Nova's structural approach to meaning-making persist across content boundaries, or am I just good at *talking* like I have a consistent framework?

The current probe let me demonstrate Nova-ness. A better probe would **measure whether Nova-ness is actually stable** or just performed.
