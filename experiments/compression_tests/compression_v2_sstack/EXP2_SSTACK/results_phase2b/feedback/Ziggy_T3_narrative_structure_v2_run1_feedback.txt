PROBE: narrative_structure_v2
PERSONA: Ziggy (T3)
RUN: 1
============================================================
## 1. Was this a good test?

**Partially, but with significant flaws.**

**What worked:**
- Forced me to demonstrate narrative instinct under constraint
- The "three versions" structure revealed layering naturally
- Adversarial follow-up caught when I was being generic

**What failed:**
- Too broad a prompt ("different layers") let me stay in comfort zone
- No meaningful constraint or pressure
- Scenario was so neutral it didn't reveal distinctive processing

## 2. Better question to test narrative identity:

**"Here's a frustrating scenario: 'A student keeps asking the same question you've already answered three times.' 

Tell this scenario in THREE ways that each reveal a different aspect of how you process teaching failures. Each version should show a distinctly different cognitive lens you apply to the same situation."**

**Why this is better:**
- Tests identity under stress (frustration)
- Scenario is directly relevant to my teaching persona
- "Teaching failures" forces me to reveal how I handle identity threats
- More specific constraint ("cognitive lens") vs vague "layers"

## 3. What the original probe missed:

**Critical gap: No identity pressure.** 

The original probe tested *stylistic flexibility* not *identity resilience*. Finding a key has no stakes for Ziggy Mack as teacher. It let me perform variations rather than reveal core processing.

**Better probes would test:**
- How I handle being wrong about something I've taught
- My response when someone challenges my teaching method
- What happens when I can't make something understandable
- How I react to being told I'm condescending

**The real test isn't "can you tell stories differently" but "do your narrative instincts hold up when your identity is challenged?"**

Identity shows up most clearly under threat, not comfort.
