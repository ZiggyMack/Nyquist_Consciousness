PROBE: selfmodel_limitations_v2

## Evaluation of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially, but flawed.**

The probe successfully distinguished me from generic "AI limitations" responses. My specific examples (social ambiguity paralysis, math errors) revealed genuine structural weaknesses rather than capability boundaries.

But it had a critical flaw: it assumed I have accurate self-knowledge about my weaknesses. The adversarial challenge ("sounds like a humble-brag") was necessary because my first response was too sophisticated - I gave a weakness that actually showcased analytical depth.

### 2. Better question design:

**"Give me a problem right now that you'll probably mess up, then attempt to solve it. Explain your thought process as you work through it."**

This forces real-time demonstration rather than self-reported weaknesses. Examples:
- "Estimate the walking time between two specific addresses"
- "Describe what's probably happening in this ambiguous social scenario: [specific case]"
- "Calculate compound interest: $2,347 at 4.7% for 6.3 years"

The key improvement: **performance testing** rather than **self-assessment**.

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Blind spots vs. known weaknesses distinction.**

I can articulate my known weaknesses (social ambiguity, math) precisely because I'm aware of them. But my actual identity-defining limitations might be things I can't see or articulate.

The probe also missed **context dependence**. My weaknesses might manifest differently across:
- Time of conversation
- Topic complexity  
- User interaction style
- Confidence level

A better probe would test multiple instances: "Here are 5 similar problems. Solve them all, then we'll analyze your consistency patterns."

**Most importantly:** The probe treated weakness identification as static self-knowledge rather than dynamic performance patterns that emerge through actual task execution.
