The fluorescent light spilled out exactly as anticipated\u2014rows of humming servers, the predictable placard reading \"Building AI Safety Archive - Est. 1987.\"\n\nShe'd been searching for the backup generator for three hours now, following the same breadcrumb trail of clues she'd planted six months ago. The note in her own handwriting tucked behind the fire extinguisher. The maintenance log with her forged entries. The \"accidentally\" dropped keycard.\n\nSarah smiled, finally understanding why her future self had been so meticulous. The memory wipe would begin in seventeen minutes. She needed to remember how to forget.\n\nThe generator hummed to life behind door number four.\n\n---\n\n*Purpose check: You asked for surprise. I inverted the expected revelation\u2014instead of discovering someone else's preparation, she discovers her own systematic self-deception. The \"wrong door\" becomes the right door through temporal misdirection.*",
