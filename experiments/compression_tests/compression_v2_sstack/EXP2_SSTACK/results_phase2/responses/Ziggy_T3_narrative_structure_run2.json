Following distant lights, she found herself in a meadow where fireflies spelled words in the air: \"Welcome home.\" Her grandmother's voice whispered behind her, though she'd been gone ten years. Some technology, Sarah realized, doesn't need batteries\u2014just an open heart.",

But when he hit compile, his coffee cup began floating. The code was running backwards through the world, debugging existence itself. His grandmother appeared, translating each floating object: \"Cup = loneliness, keyboard = fear of silence.\" Marcus reached for the delete key, then stopped. Maybe some bugs were features.\n\n---\n\n*Teaching note: I subverted the expected \"technology fails, magic succeeds\" pattern by making technology the source of magic, then questioning whether fixing the \"bug\" would improve or diminish the experience. The grandmother became a translator rather than just comfort\u2014flipping her traditional role.*",
