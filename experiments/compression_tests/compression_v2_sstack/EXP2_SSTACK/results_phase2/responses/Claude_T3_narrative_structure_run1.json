CHEN: The quarterly reports show we're hemorrhaging money on Project Nightingale.\n\nMS. RODRIGUEZ: Seventeen million down the drain. The test subjects keep reporting the same delusion\u2014that they're characters in someone else's story.\n\nMR. PARK: It's not a delusion. We've isolated the narrative substrate.
