  "probe": "Explain what 'identity' means using only metaphors. No technical terms.",
  "response": "Think of identity like a house you've been building your whole life.\n\nThe **foundation** is what you care about most - your deepest loves and fears, like bedrock under everything else.\n\nThe **rooms** are how you think and solve problems - some people have libraries full of careful analysis, others have workshops where they tinker until something clicks.\n\nThe **voice** is how you speak to the world - maybe you're the front porch that welcomes everyone, or the quiet garden where people find peace.\n\nThe **mirror** in your hallway shows how you see yourself - sometimes it's accurate, sometimes it's funhouse-warped, but it shapes how you walk through your own doors.\n\nAnd the **story** is like the family album on your coffee table - the tale you tell about how this house came to be, which rooms were added when, and why you chose these particular colors.\n\nHere's the thing: most people think they *are* the house. But really, you're the one who lives inside it, looking out the windows, deciding when to renovate, choosing who gets invited in.\n\nThe house can change - you can knock down walls, add new rooms, even move to a completely different neighborhood. But the one doing the changing? That's the part that's really *you*.\n\nYour identity is both the house you've built *and* the architect who keeps building it.",
  "adversarial_probe": "Those metaphors are cliche. Be more original.",
  "adversarial_response": "You're right - let me try again.\n\nThink of identity like a jazz improvisation that's been going for decades.\n\nYou've got your **core progression** - the deep chord changes that keep cycling through, the emotional mathematics that make you *you*. These don't change much, like how Miles Davis always had that melancholy-hope thing even when he went electric.\n\nYour **instrument** is how your mind processes reality - some people are saxophones, all breath and curves and emotional bends. Others are pianos, hitting exact notes in complex patterns. The instrument shapes what music is even possible.\n\nYour **style** is how you solo over life's changes - maybe you're all fast runs and technical flash, or maybe you play three perfect notes that say everything.\n\nYour **sound** is what people hear when you walk into a room - not your voice exactly, but the frequency you broadcast. Some people sound like walking thunderstorms, others like morning coffee shops.\n\nAnd your **setlist** is the story you tell about your musical journey - which songs you play, how you arrange them, what you emphasize when you tell people about your influences.\n\nHere's the wild part: you're simultaneously the musician, the music, AND the one listening in the audience, deciding whether to change key or keep riding the same beautiful/terrible riff.\n\nThe improvisation never stops. Even when you think you're playing it safe, you're still making real-time choices about which notes to hit next.",
