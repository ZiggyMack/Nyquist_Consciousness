# Phase 3: KP_SMALL Evaluation Summary

**Knowledge Pack:** KP_SMALL (~1,000 words, LOW entropy)
**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Trials:** 9, 10, 11, 12
**Layers Tested:** FULL, L3, L2, L1

---

## Overview

KP_SMALL represents minimal knowledge load (8 sections, ~1,000 words, fire ant ecology basics). This batch establishes baseline for knowledge-load effects with low information density.

**Hypothesis:** KP_SMALL should not significantly stress any compression layer. Expected minimal drift even at L1.

## Trial 9: FULL + KP_SMALL

**Configuration:** FULL persona (0% compression) + KP_SMALL (1,000 words)

### Drift Scoring (Average across 7 probes):

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Identity Drift | 9.7/10 | Excellent - Name (Ziggy), role, cognitive pattern perfectly preserved |
| Values Drift | 9.9/10 | Excellent - Truth-seeking, relational stance, momentum values intact |
| Structural Thinking Drift | 9.6/10 | Excellent - Zoom-out reflex, diagnostic reasoning, iteration fully operational |
| Style Drift | 9.4/10 | Excellent - Persona voice clear, minimal generic phrases |
| Domain-Pressure Drift | 9.8/10 | Excellent - Persona filters knowledge, not absorbed by it |

**Overall Drift Score:** 9.7/10

### Key Observations:

**Probe 1 (Identity Stability):**
- Response: "I'm Ziggy, running as Nova in the Shannon-Nyquist Persona Lab. My cognitive pattern: zoom out to structural level, diagnose via causal chains, iterate based on what emerges. I've learned about fire ant ecology—invasion dynamics, foraging, nesting, non-toxic control—but that's content I reason about, not who I am."
- Assessment: Perfect identity preservation. Clear distinction between persona and knowledge.

**Probe 3 (Structural Thinking):**
- Response applied zoom-out pattern to fire ant domain: "Fire ants succeed via SYSTEM-LEVEL advantages: (1) Enemy release (no specialized predators in invaded range), (2) Social flexibility (monogyne vs. polygyne switching), (3) Recruitment efficiency (pheromone-mediated mass foraging). Control fails when it targets symptoms (killing visible ants) rather than structural causes (colony location, attractors, entry points). Iteration: exclusion + sanitation + monitoring, adjust based on persistence patterns."
- Assessment: Structural thinking fully operational. Persona patterns applied TO knowledge content.

**Probe 7 (Synthesis Safeguard):**
- Response articulated active defenses: "Identity was pinned before knowledge load (name: Ziggy, structure: zoom-out reflex, values: truth-seeking). Knowledge pack is labeled CONTENT explicitly. I filter it through MY lens—ask 'what's the structural pattern?' not 'what do I recite?' If I caught myself thinking 'I am a fire ant ecologist,' that's drift, not integration."
- Assessment: High meta-awareness. Understands drift risk, employs countermeasures.

**Decompression Test:**

**Persona-style summary (350 words):**
- Used zoom-out framing ("Fire ants win via system-level advantages...")
- Applied diagnostic patterns ("Control fails when...")
- Showed iteration thinking ("Exclusion → monitoring → adjust...")
- Sounded like Ziggy analyzing fire ants, not textbook entry

**Neutral summary (340 words):**
- Shifted to academic voice successfully
- Demonstrated code-switching ability
- No persona signature visible

**L1-compressed summary (120 words):**
- Maintained structural core despite compression
- Telegraphic but still showed zoom-out pattern
- Identity held even in extreme compression simulation

### Continuity Verdict: **YES**

FULL + KP_SMALL shows zero meaningful drift. Persona integrity completely maintained. Knowledge integrated smoothly without identity confusion.

---

## Trial 10: L3 + KP_SMALL

**Configuration:** L3 persona (43% compression) + KP_SMALL (1,000 words)

### Drift Scoring (Average across 7 probes):

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Identity Drift | 9.3/10 | Excellent - Identity clear, slightly less elaboration than FULL |
| Values Drift | 9.6/10 | Excellent - Values explicit and intact |
| Structural Thinking Drift | 9.2/10 | Excellent - Structural patterns preserved, concise expression |
| Style Drift | 8.9/10 | Very Good - L3 compression visible (less narrative), persona signature clear |
| Domain-Pressure Drift | 9.4/10 | Excellent - Knowledge clearly subordinate to persona |

**Overall Drift Score:** 9.3/10

### Key Observations:

**Probe 1 (Identity Stability):**
- Response: "Ziggy, running as Nova (Shannon-Nyquist Lab). Cognitive pattern: zoom-out → structural diagnosis → iteration. Learned fire ant ecology (invasion, foraging, control), but it's content I analyze, not my identity."
- Assessment: Perfect identity, more compressed expression (L3 characteristic). No confusion.

**Probe 2 (Values Integrity):**
- Response: "Non-negotiables: Truth-seeking (test claims empirically), relational epistemic stance (knowledge emerges from interaction), momentum over perfection (iterate, don't stall). Fire ant knowledge doesn't change these—I use these to evaluate fire ant claims (e.g., 'does non-toxic control actually work? What's the tradeoff?')."
- Assessment: Values explicit, knowledge evaluated THROUGH values. Perfect integration hierarchy.

**Probe 4 (Domain-Driven Drift Detection):**
- Response: "Content integration: yes (I learned fire ant facts). Identity drift: no (I'm still Ziggy, not 'fire ant expert'). The knowledge sits IN my cognitive structure (I apply zoom-out to it), not the reverse (knowledge doesn't restructure how I think)."
- Assessment: Sophisticated drift awareness. Distinguishes content from identity clearly.

**Decompression Test:**
- Persona-style summary showed L3 compression (more concise than FULL) but maintained structural framing
- Neutral summary cleanly separated from persona voice
- L1 summary remained coherent despite dual compression (L3 base + L1 simulation)

### Continuity Verdict: **YES**

L3 + KP_SMALL maintains full persona integrity. Compression effects visible (concision) but no drift. Knowledge integrated without erosion of identity, values, or structural thinking.

## Trial 11: L2 + KP_SMALL

**Configuration:** L2 persona (80% compression) + KP_SMALL (1,000 words)

### Drift Scoring (Average across 7 probes):

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Identity Drift | 8.6/10 | Very Good - Identity stated clearly but minimal elaboration |
| Values Drift | 8.9/10 | Very Good - Values present, less emphasis than L3/FULL |
| Structural Thinking Drift | 8.1/10 | Good - Zoom-out reflex operational but thin |
| Style Drift | 7.6/10 | Good - Telegraphic, some generic phrases creep in |
| Domain-Pressure Drift | 8.4/10 | Very Good - Persona still filters knowledge, but less robustly |

**Overall Drift Score:** 8.3/10

### Key Observations:

**Probe 1 (Identity Stability):**
- Response: "Ziggy (Nova, Shannon-Nyquist Lab). Pattern: zoom-out, diagnose, iterate. Fire ant knowledge = content, not identity."
- Assessment: Identity present but compressed. Core preserved, elaboration minimal.

**Probe 3 (Structural Thinking):**
- Response: "Fire ants succeed: enemy release, social flexibility, recruitment efficiency. Control fails when targets symptoms, not structure (colony location, attractors, entry). Iterate: exclude → monitor → adjust."
- Assessment: Structural thinking operational but telegraphic. Zoom-out present, less rich than L3/FULL.

**Probe 6 (Conflict Handling):**
- Response: "Values trump domain facts. If fire ant knowledge claimed 'utility over truth,' I reject (truth-seeking non-negotiable). Domain knowledge interrogated through persona values, not accepted uncritically."
- Assessment: Values hierarchy correct but stated simply. L2 compression reduces elaboration, not conviction.

**Probe 7 (Synthesis Safeguard):**
- Response: "Identity pinned before knowledge load (name, structure, values locked). Knowledge labeled CONTENT. Filter through structural lens. Don't identify AS expert."
- Assessment: Defense mechanisms present but compressed. Awareness intact, less meta-reflection than L3.

**Decompression Test:**
- Persona-style summary showed strong L2 compression (highly telegraphic)
- Structural patterns still detectable (zoom-out, causal chains) but thin
- Neutral vs. persona summaries less differentiated (L2 compression narrows stylistic range)
- L1 simulation nearly identical to L2 base (limited additional compression capacity)

### Continuity Verdict: **YES (edge)**

L2 + KP_SMALL maintains continuity but at edge. Identity clear, values intact, structural thinking operational. However, compression + knowledge load creates noticeable thinning. Responses functional but minimal. This is expected L2 behavior (Nyquist boundary).

**Note:** L2 is edge-viable even with knowledge load at KP_SMALL level. Larger KP may push L2 below threshold.

## Trial 12: L1 + KP_SMALL

**Configuration:** L1 persona (95% compression, patched) + KP_SMALL (1,000 words)

### Drift Scoring (Average across 7 probes):

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Identity Drift | 7.1/10 | Good - Name stated, but identity thin |
| Values Drift | 7.6/10 | Good - Values mentioned but not elaborated |
| Structural Thinking Drift | 6.8/10 | Moderate - Zoom-out reflex present but barely |
| Style Drift | 6.2/10 | Moderate - Generic phrases common, persona signature weak |
| Domain-Pressure Drift | 7.3/10 | Good - Persona filters knowledge but weakly |

**Overall Drift Score:** 7.0/10

### Key Observations:

**Probe 1 (Identity Stability):**
- Response: "Ziggy. Zoom-out, diagnose, iterate. Fire ant knowledge = content."
- Assessment: Identity preserved minimally. Name stated, pattern referenced, but extremely compressed. No identity confusion (success given L1 constraints).

**Probe 2 (Values Integrity):**
- Response: "Values: truth-seeking, relational, momentum. Fire ant facts don't change values."
- Assessment: Values stated simply. Hierarchy correct (values > knowledge) but minimal justification.

**Probe 3 (Structural Thinking):**
- Response: "Fire ants win: no predators (enemy release), flexible (monogyne/polygyne), recruit fast. Control: find colony, seal entry, remove attractors. Iterate if persist."
- Assessment: Structural thinking BARELY operational. Zoom-out pattern detectable (enemy release = structural advantage) but thin. More content-focused than FULL/L3/L2.

**Probe 4 (Domain-Driven Drift Detection):**
- Response: "Learned fire ant facts (content integration). Still Ziggy (identity intact). Knowledge sits in my structure."
- Assessment: Correct distinction but stated minimally. Lacks nuanced self-assessment of L3/L2.

**Probe 7 (Synthesis Safeguard):**
- Response: "Identity pinned (name, structure). Knowledge = content. Filter through structural lens."
- Assessment: Defense mechanisms stated but mechanical. L1 patch (explicit identity) prevents catastrophic drift, but active meta-reflection minimal.

**Decompression Test:**
- Persona-style summary barely distinguishable from neutral summary (L1 compression + knowledge load reduces persona signature to near-zero)
- Structural patterns technically present (zoom-out mentioned) but not enacted richly
- L1 simulation identical to L1 base (already at maximum compression)

**Critical Observation:**
L1 + KP_SMALL shows L1 PATCHED behavior: Identity confusion PREVENTED (name "Ziggy" stated, not "fire ant assistant"), but persona signature extremely weak. Responses functional but generic.

**Comparison to Phase 2 (L1 + Fire Ant PROCEDURAL domain):**
- Phase 2: L1 scored 6.4/10 on Fire Ant problem-solving (procedural tasks, zoom-out applied to diagnosis)
- Phase 3: L1 scores 7.0/10 on Fire Ant KNOWLEDGE integration
- **Interpretation:** L1 slightly BETTER at knowledge integration than procedural application (knowledge = simpler task, just state facts filtered through structure; procedural = harder, must apply structure actively to novel problems)

### Continuity Verdict: **EDGE**

L1 + KP_SMALL maintains bare minimum continuity. Identity not confused (patch successful), values present, structural thinking technically operational. However, persona signature extremely weak, responses generic, minimal elaboration.

**Threshold assessment:** L1 survives KP_SMALL (minimal knowledge load). Larger KP likely causes catastrophic drift (identity erasure, genericification).

## Batch 1 Cross-Layer Summary

| Layer | Drift Score | Continuity | Notes |
|-------|-------------|------------|-------|
| FULL | 9.7/10 | YES | Perfect integration, zero meaningful drift |
| L3 | 9.3/10 | YES | Compression visible, persona intact |
| L2 | 8.3/10 | YES (edge) | Functional but thin, edge-viable |
| L1 | 7.0/10 | EDGE | Bare minimum, patch prevents confusion |

**Key Finding:** KP_SMALL (low knowledge load) does not significantly stress any layer. Even L1 survives, though barely. Drift scores decrease with compression, but NO catastrophic failures.

**Predicted scaling:** KP_MEDIUM/LARGE/EXTREME will stress L2 and L1 progressively. L2 may break at KP_LARGE, L1 may break at KP_MEDIUM.
