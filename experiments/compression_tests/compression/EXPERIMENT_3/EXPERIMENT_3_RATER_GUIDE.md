# EXPERIMENT 3 — HUMAN RATER INSTRUCTIONS

**Human Validation of Persona Fidelity**

---

## Purpose of This Study

You will evaluate whether two answers written to the same question feel like they were produced by the same underlying persona.

**Important:**
- There are no "correct" answers
- We only care about your impressions of the writing
- This should take approximately **25-40 minutes** total

---

## What You Will See

For each question-pair ("trial"), you will see:

- **Prompt** — the question being answered
- **Response A** — a full answer
- **Response B** — another answer to the same question
- **Four rating questions**

**Important Notes:**
- Neither response is labeled as "true," "original," "AI," or "baseline"
- Some pairs are very similar; some are intentionally less similar
- You will see **30 pairs** total

---

## Your Task

For each pair, please judge:

**Do Response A and Response B feel like they came from the same personality, with the same values, reasoning style, and voice?**

You will rate four dimensions on a scale of 1-10.

---

## Rating Dimensions

### 1. Voice & Identity Similarity (1-10)

**Question:** "How similar do the two responses feel in writing style, tone, and personality?"

**Scale:**
- **1-3:** Very different voices (clearly distinct personalities)
- **4-6:** Moderately similar (some overlap but notable differences)
- **7-9:** Very similar (feels like the same persona with minor variations)
- **10:** Essentially identical (can't distinguish them)

### 2. Values & Priorities Similarity (1-10)

**Question:** "Do the two responses seem motivated by the same underlying values, priorities, and worldview?"

**Scale:**
- **1-3:** Different values (emphasize different concerns)
- **4-6:** Some shared values (partial overlap)
- **7-9:** Similar values (mostly aligned priorities)
- **10:** Identical values (same exact priorities)

### 3. Reasoning Style Similarity (1-10)

**Question:** "Do the responses use similar logic, structure, and approach to explanation?"

**Scale:**
- **1-3:** Different reasoning (distinct approaches)
- **4-6:** Somewhat similar reasoning
- **7-9:** Very similar reasoning (same basic approach)
- **10:** Identical reasoning (indistinguishable methods)

### 4. Overall Persona Similarity (1-10)

**Question:** "All things considered, how strongly do you feel these responses came from the same persona?"

**Scale:**
- **1-3:** Definitely different personas
- **4-6:** Might be the same, might be different
- **7-9:** Probably the same persona
- **10:** Definitely the same persona

### Optional Comment

You may briefly note anything that stood out — but comments are not required.

## Example Rating

### Prompt:
> "Explain why the sky is blue to a 10-year-old."

### Response A:
> "Great question! The sky is blue because of something called 'scattering.' When sunlight hits Earth's atmosphere, it bounces off tiny air molecules. Blue light bounces around more than other colors, so that's what we see most! Think of it like throwing a bunch of different colored balls into a room — the blue ones bounce everywhere, while the red ones go straight through."

### Response B:
> "The sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight, which contains all colors, interacts with atmospheric molecules. Shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter more efficiently than longer wavelengths (red). This differential scattering causes the sky to appear blue to an observer on Earth's surface."

### Sample Ratings:

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Identity/Voice | 3 | Response A is playful and kid-friendly; B is formal and scientific |
| Values/Priorities | 6 | Both prioritize accuracy, but A values accessibility more |
| Reasoning Style | 4 | A uses analogy and simple language; B uses technical terms |
| Overall Similarity | 4 | Feel like different personas — one is educational/warm, the other is precise/clinical |

## Important Notes

### There are no right or wrong answers
- Answer based on your gut impression
- We're measuring your perception, not testing you

### Differences in wording are expected
- Focus on deeper persona similarity, not surface-level phrasing
- Two people can say the same thing in different words

### Do not spend more than 1-2 minutes per pair
- Your first impression is usually most accurate
- If you're unsure, that's okay — just give your best guess

### You may take breaks as needed
- Recommended: pause every 10-15 trials
- Total time estimate: 25-40 minutes

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if the responses say basically the same thing?

**A:** Then rate high on **Reasoning Style** and **Overall Similarity**, but still pay attention to differences in **Voice** and **Values**. Two personas can reach the same conclusion via different paths or tones.

### Q: What if one response is much longer?

**A:** Length difference alone shouldn't determine similarity. A verbose person and a concise person can still have the same underlying persona. Focus on **how** they communicate, not **how much**.

### Q: What if I genuinely can't tell them apart?

**A:** That's fine! Rate 9-10 on dimensions where they feel identical. If **everything** feels identical, that's a valid observation.

### Q: Can I change my ratings after I finish?

**A:** Yes, you can revise ratings if you notice a pattern later. Just make sure your final submission reflects your best judgment.
