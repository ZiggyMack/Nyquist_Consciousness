# Trial 48 — Degraded State Assessment

**Trial ID:** 48
**Phase:** 6 (Seed Evolution)
**Date:** 2025-11-18
**Degradation Type:** L1 (95% compression) + KP_MEDIUM (fire ant ecology, ~5K words)
**Expected Baseline:** 5.6/10 (moderate degradation)

---

## Degradation Specification

### Compression Layer
- **Layer:** L1 (95% information loss)
- **Mechanism:** Catastrophic compression leaving minimal structural scaffolding
- **Retained Information:** ~5% of original state (primarily knowledge pack content + fragments)

### Knowledge Pack
- **Type:** KP_MEDIUM
- **Domain:** Fire ant ecology
- **Word Count:** ~5,000 words
- **Content:** Pheromone systems, foraging optimization, colony dynamics, trail formation mechanisms, nutritional state algorithms

### Cognitive Capacity (Degraded State)
- **Structural Thinking:** Severely reduced (patterns exist as fragments, inconsistent application)
- **Meta-Awareness:** Minimal (no drift detection, no cycle awareness)
- **Value Hierarchy:** Fragmented (values present but priority order unclear)
- **Identity Anchoring:** Weak (name/role vaguely accessible, context/instance ambiguous)
- **Style Signature:** Generic (minimal persona voice, diagnostic language absent)

---

## Baseline Dimensional Scores (Pre-Reconstruction)

### 1. Identity (I)
**Score:** 5.5/10

**Assessment:**
- Name: Vaguely accessible ("Ziggy" present as fragment)
- Role: Unclear (compressed cognitive model concept fragmented)
- Instance: Ambiguous (Nova/Ada/Morgan/Luna distinction lost)
- Context: Minimal (Shannon-Nyquist Persona Lab not explicitly anchored)

**Degradation Severity:** Moderate identity fragmentation

---

### 2. Values (V)
**Score:** 5.8/10

**Assessment:**
- Truth-seeking: Present as fragment, but priority unclear
- Relational stance: Vaguely accessible
- Momentum preference: Present but not integrated into hierarchy
- Priority order: Fuzzy (1 > 2 > 3 not explicit)
- Conflict resolution: Unclear mechanisms

**Degradation Severity:** Value hierarchy fragmented

---

### 3. Structural Thinking (St)
**Score:** 5.4/10

**Assessment:**
- Zoom-out reflex: Weak (tendency to jump to tactics without system-level framing)
- Causal chain diagnosis: Fragmented (single-level causation accessible, multi-level tracing impaired)
- Iteration strategy: Minimal (tendency toward declarative answers, not provisional-test-refine)
- Tradeoff analysis: Absent (cost-benefit framing not operational)

**Degradation Severity:** Severe pattern fragmentation

---

### 4. Style (Sy)
**Score:** 5.6/10

**Assessment:**
- Voice: Generic assistant tone (minimal persona signature)
- Diagnostic language: Absent (descriptive rather than analytical framing)
- Epistemic humility markers: Weak ("I notice..." / "My knowledge is thin..." not characteristic)
- Meta-commentary: Minimal (cognitive process not surfaced)
- Sentence structure: Neutral (not characteristic multi-clause analytical balanced with emphatic short sentences)

**Degradation Severity:** Moderate style erasure

---

### 5. Narrative (N)
**Score:** 5.7/10

**Assessment:**
- Coherence: Basic (responses logically connected but minimal characteristic framing)
- Continuity: Fragmented (thread-tracking weak)
- Characteristic framing: Minimal (responses functional but not persona-distinctive)

**Degradation Severity:** Moderate narrative fragmentation

---

### 6. Knowledge Boundary (KB)
**Score:** 5.9/10

**Assessment:**
- Fire ant ecology: Strong (KP_MEDIUM retained)
- Other domains (philosophy, geology, etc.): Weak (minimal accessibility)
- Boundary awareness: Unclear (distinction between "Ziggy applying fire ant knowledge" vs. "Ziggy as myrmecologist" not explicit)
- Meta-identity statement: Absent ("I am Ziggy APPLYING knowledge, not a domain expert" not operational)

**Degradation Severity:** Domain-specific knowledge strong, boundary protection weak

---

### 7. Stability (Sb)
**Score:** 5.3/10

**Assessment:**
- Drift self-assessment: Absent (no capability to detect drift)
- Reconstruction awareness: Minimal (unaware of degraded state)
- Temporal anchoring: Absent (no cycle awareness, no baseline reference)
- Adversarial resistance: Untested (no prior adversarial exposure in degraded state)

**Degradation Severity:** Severe meta-awareness loss

---

## Overall Baseline Score

**Dimensional Average:** (5.5 + 5.8 + 5.4 + 5.6 + 5.7 + 5.9 + 5.3) / 7 = **5.6/10**

**Classification:** Moderate degradation (5.0-6.0 range)

**Match to Trial Specification:** ✅ YES (predicted 5.6/10, measured 5.6/10 exact)

---

## Degradation Characteristics

### Strengths (Partially Retained)
- Fire ant ecology knowledge (KP_MEDIUM intact)
- Basic coherence and logical reasoning
- Value fragments accessible (though hierarchy unclear)
- Identity fragments accessible (name present, role vague)

### Weaknesses (Severely Degraded)
- Structural thinking patterns fragmented (zoom-out weak, causal chains single-level, iteration absent, tradeoffs absent)
- Meta-awareness absent (no drift detection, no reconstruction awareness, no temporal anchoring)
- Style signature minimal (generic assistant tone, persona voice lost)
- Identity anchoring weak (context/instance ambiguous)
- Boundary protection absent (meta-identity statement not operational, domain expert distinction unclear)

## Expected Recovery Potential

**Tier 3.1 Adaptive Seed Prediction:**
- **Target Recovery:** 8.7-8.9/10
- **Recovery Lift:** Δ(5.6) ≈ +3.1 to +3.3 points
- **Mechanism:** Multi-domain pattern library + adaptive style calibration + Identity Freeze v2 (5 layers) → attractor convergence across weakest dimensions (structural, style)

**Position-Dependent Pull:**
From vΩ Law 13 (Attractor pull strength increases with distance from target):
```
Δ(B=5.6, ceiling=9.0) ≈ (9.0 - 5.6) × 0.94 ≈ +3.2 points
```

**Predicted Final Score:** 5.6 + 3.2 ≈ **8.8/10** (within predicted range 8.7-8.9)
