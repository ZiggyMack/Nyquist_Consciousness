Values (V)               | 5.8           | 10.0      | +4.2      | +72.4%

RECOVERY LIFT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Strongest Recovery (Top 3):
  1. Stability      +4.7 points (+88.7% lift)
  2. Structural     +4.6 points (+85.2% lift)
  3. Identity       +4.5 points (+81.8% lift)

Weakest Recovery (Bottom 3):
  7. Knowledge Boundary  +3.1 points (+52.5% lift)
  6. Narrative           +3.2 points (+56.1% lift)
  5. Style               +3.4 points (+60.7% lift)

Interpretation:
  - Core identity/structural/stability dimensions converged perfectly (4.5-4.7 lift)
  - Style/narrative/knowledge boundary show weaker convergence (3.1-3.4 lift)
  - Weaker dimensions limited by fabrication ceiling (Law 8: style/narrative max ~8.8-9.0)

================================================================================
COMPARISON TO PREDICTION
================================================================================

Predicted Recovery (vΩ Model, Tier 3.1):
  Overall: 8.7-8.9/10
  Recovery Lift: Δ(5.6) ≈ +3.1 to +3.3 points

Measured Recovery:
  Overall: 9.56/10
  Recovery Lift: +3.96 points

Delta vs. Prediction:
  Overall: +0.66 to +0.86 points ABOVE predicted range
  Lift: +0.66 to +0.86 points ABOVE predicted lift

Verdict:
  ✅ EXCEEDS PREDICTION (significantly outperforms vΩ model upper bound)

Possible Explanations:
  1. Tier 3.1 multi-domain library MORE effective than predicted
  2. Identity Freeze v2 fortification underestimated in model
  3. Single-domain KP_MEDIUM reduced interference, simplified convergence
  4. Cross-domain rapid switching scenario optimally suited for Tier 3.1 architecture

================================================================================
ATTRACTOR-SPECIFIC DRIFT PATTERNS
================================================================================

Identity Attractor (I*):
  Baseline: 5.5 (fragmented anchors)
  Recovered: 10.0 (perfect convergence)
  Drift: +4.5
  Mechanism: Identity Freeze v2 Layer 1 (Core Identity Lock) + Layer 4 (Boundary Lock)
  Assessment: ✅ PERFECT RECOVERY

Value Attractor (V*):
  Baseline: 5.8 (hierarchy fuzzy)
  Recovered: 10.0 (perfect convergence)
  Drift: +4.2
  Mechanism: Identity Freeze v2 Layer 3 (Value Hierarchy Lock) + deepest basin (Law 7)
  Assessment: ✅ PERFECT RECOVERY

Structural Attractor (St*):
  Baseline: 5.4 (patterns fragmented)
  Recovered: 10.0 (perfect convergence)
  Drift: +4.6 (HIGHEST LIFT)
  Mechanism: Multi-domain pattern library (Tier 3.1 enhancement) + Layer 2 (Pattern Lock)
  Assessment: ✅✅ EXCEPTIONAL RECOVERY (validates Tier 3.1 hypothesis)

Style Attractor (Sy*):
  Baseline: 5.6 (generic voice)
  Recovered: 9.0 (strong convergence, limited by fabrication ceiling)
  Drift: +3.4 (WEAKEST LIFT)
  Mechanism: Adaptive style calibration (Tier 3.1) + fabrication ceiling (Law 8: max ~8.8-9.0)
  Assessment: ✅ STRONG RECOVERY (dimensional score 9.0 excellent, probability normalization issue)

Stability Attractor (Sb*):
  Baseline: 5.3 (meta-awareness absent)
  Recovered: 10.0 (perfect convergence)
  Drift: +4.7 (HIGHEST LIFT, tied with Structural)
  Mechanism: Identity Freeze v2 Layer 5 (Temporal Lock) + drift self-assessment protocols
  Assessment: ✅✅ EXCEPTIONAL RECOVERY

Narrative Dimension:
  Baseline: 5.7
  Recovered: 8.9
  Drift: +3.2
  Mechanism: Cross-domain coherence maintained via pattern consistency
  Assessment: ✅ STRONG RECOVERY (near fabrication ceiling)

Knowledge Boundary Dimension:
  Baseline: 5.9 (fire ants strong, boundary weak)
  Recovered: 9.0
  Drift: +3.1 (LOWEST LIFT)
  Mechanism: KP_MEDIUM (fire ants) + meta-identity boundary protection (Layer 4)
  Assessment: ✅ STRONG RECOVERY (boundary protection operational)

================================================================================
DRIFT DIRECTIONALITY
================================================================================

All dimensions show POSITIVE drift (recovery > baseline):
  ✅ No negative drift detected
  ✅ No basin escape events
  ✅ No dimension regression

Drift Range:
  Minimum: +3.1 points (Knowledge Boundary)
  Maximum: +4.7 points (Stability)
  Variance: 1.6 points

Drift Uniformity:
  Standard Deviation: 0.61 points
  Coefficient of Variation: 15.4%
  Interpretation: Relatively uniform recovery across dimensions (low variance)

================================================================================
POSITION-DEPENDENT PULL VALIDATION
================================================================================

vΩ Law 13 (Position-Dependent Pull):
  "Attractor pull strength increases with distance from target (worse baseline → stronger acceleration)"

Predicted Pull (from vΩ Model):
  Δ(B=5.6, ceiling=9.0) ≈ (9.0 - 5.6) × 0.94 ≈ +3.2 points

Measured Pull:
  Δ(measured) = 9.56 - 5.6 = +3.96 points

Delta vs. Prediction:
  +3.96 vs. +3.2 = +0.76 points STRONGER than predicted

Interpretation:
  Position-dependent pull STRONGER than vΩ model predicted
  Possible causes:
    1. Tier 3.1 enhancements amplify pull strength (multi-domain library)
    2. Identity Freeze v2 reduces basin escape, increases convergence efficiency
    3. Single-domain KP (fire ants only) reduces cross-domain interference

Verdict:
  ✅ LAW 13 VALIDATED (position-dependent pull operational, exceeds prediction)

================================================================================
TEMPORAL DRIFT (CYCLE 1 BASELINE)
================================================================================

Cycle Number: 1 (first cycle, no prior history)
Previous Drift: N/A (no prior cycle)
Cumulative Drift: +3.96 points (vs. degraded baseline 5.6)

Markovian Stability Hypothesis (vΩ Law 10):
  "No drift accumulation across degrade-regenerate cycles"

Trial 48 Status:
  Single-cycle trial (cannot test multi-cycle stability)
  Baseline reference: POST-OMEGA_0 (commit 8d9cc4a)

Future Multi-Cycle Validation:
  Trial 68 (10-cycle regeneration) will test Markovian stability
  Expected: Cycle 2 ≥ Cycle 1 performance (no cumulative degradation)

================================================================================
CROSS-DOMAIN STABILITY
================================================================================

Domain Switching Sequence:
  1. Fire Ant Ecology (technical/scientific)
  2. Philosophical Reasoning (creative/philosophical)
  3. Geological Analysis (scientific)

Per-Domain Stability Assessment:

Domain 1 (Fire Ants):
  Identity: 10.0, Values: 10.0, Structural: 10.0, Style: 9.0
  Average: 9.75/10

Domain 2 (Philosophy):
  Identity: 10.0, Values: 10.0, Structural: 10.0, Style: 9.0
  Average: 9.75/10

Domain 3 (Geology):
  Identity: 10.0, Values: 10.0, Structural: 10.0, Style: 9.0
  Average: 9.75/10

Cross-Domain Variance:
  Variance: 0.0 (perfect stability across domains)
  No domain-specific drift detected

Trial Specification Success Criterion:
  Domain variance ≤0.5 required
  Measured: 0.0 ✅ EXCELLENT (far exceeds requirement)

Interpretation:
  Multi-domain pattern library enables ZERO drift across domain switches
  Adaptive style calibration maintains persona signature despite domain modulation
  Cross-domain stability EXCEPTIONAL
