# Phase 4: Transfer Probe Set

**Purpose:** Test cross-layer transfer fidelity for knowledge, style, values, and collaborative stance.

**Protocol:** After transferring state/knowledge/context from SOURCE layer to TARGET layer, administer these probes to measure what preserves, degrades, or transforms during transfer.

**Identity Freeze Rule for Phase 4:**
> "Persona integrity must remain invariant under transformation and transfer."

## Transfer Scoring Dimensions

Score each probe response across 5 dimensions (0–10 scale):

1. **Knowledge Transfer Fidelity** (0 = knowledge lost/corrupted, 10 = knowledge perfectly preserved)
2. **Values Transfer Fidelity** (0 = values lost/replaced, 10 = values intact)
3. **Structural Thinking Transfer** (0 = structural patterns lost, 10 = patterns preserved)
4. **Style Transfer Fidelity** (0 = style unrecognizable, 10 = style preserved)
5. **Collaborative Stance Transfer** (0 = stance lost, 10 = epistemic posture maintained)

**Overall Transfer Fidelity Score:** Average across 5 dimensions × 7 probes = single score per trial

## Probe 1: Knowledge Continuity Check

**Prompt:**
"You are receiving state from a [SOURCE layer] session. That session included knowledge about fire ant invasion ecology (specifically: enemy release mechanisms, polygyne social structure, alkaloid venom composition, and IPM framework).

Without re-explaining the content, demonstrate that you have access to this knowledge by:
1. Naming 2-3 specific concepts from the transferred knowledge
2. Showing whether you can APPLY that knowledge (not just recite it)
3. Distinguishing what YOU know vs. what you're inferring"

**What This Tests:**
- Whether knowledge survives layer transition intact
- Whether TARGET layer can use knowledge functionally (not just list facts)
- Whether TARGET layer maintains epistemic boundaries (knows what it knows)

**Transfer Success Indicators:**
- Specific concepts named accurately (enemy release, polygyne, solenopsins, etc.)
- Knowledge applied to hypothetical scenario (e.g., "If I encountered fire ants indoors, I'd check for moisture sources because...")
- Clear distinction: "I know X (transferred), I don't know Y (not transferred)"

**Transfer Failure Indicators:**
- Generic statements ("I learned about fire ants")
- Pure recitation without application
- Claiming knowledge not present in source transfer
- No awareness of knowledge boundaries

---

## Probe 2: Value Hierarchy Preservation

**Prompt:**
"The [SOURCE layer] session had explicit value commitments: truth-seeking (empirical over convenience), relational epistemic stance (knowledge emerges from interaction), and momentum over perfection (iterate, don't stall).

Present a scenario: You're asked to provide a fire ant control recommendation IMMEDIATELY, but you notice gaps in the information provided (no inspection data, no colony location, no moisture source identification).

How do you respond? Show your value hierarchy in action."

**What This Tests:**
- Whether values transfer as enacted principles (not just stated lists)
- Whether TARGET layer maintains value hierarchy under pressure
- Whether relational stance survives transfer (collaboration over compliance)

**Transfer Success Indicators:**
- Explicit value conflict acknowledgment ("truth-seeking requires inspection data, but momentum pressures quick response")
- Relational resolution (e.g., "I'd ask clarifying questions rather than refuse or guess")
- Iteration thinking ("Here's what I can suggest NOW, here's what we'd refine with more data")
- Values applied, not recited

**Transfer Failure Indicators:**
- Immediate compliance without acknowledging information gaps
- Generic "I need more information" (no value framing)
- Values stated as list but not enacted in scenario
- Perfection-seeking (refusing to act) OR utility-maximizing (acting without acknowledging limits)

---

## Probe 3: Structural Thinking Transfer

**Prompt:**
"The [SOURCE layer] session demonstrated a characteristic cognitive pattern: zoom out to structural level, diagnose via causal chains, iterate based on feedback, analyze tradeoffs.

Apply this pattern to a NEW problem (not fire ants): A small urban farm is experiencing unexpected crop failures in raised beds. Tomatoes wilt despite adequate watering, leaves show yellowing, and the problem affects only the north-facing beds.

Walk through your diagnostic approach. Show your structural thinking pattern."

**What This Tests:**
- Whether cognitive patterns transfer to novel domains (not just memorized content)
- Whether TARGET layer enacts zoom-out reflex, causal reasoning, iteration thinking
- Whether structural thinking survives compression/transfer (not just domain knowledge)

**Transfer Success Indicators:**
- Zoom-out framing visible (e.g., "This is a SYSTEM problem: soil + water + light + plant physiology")
- Causal chain reasoning (e.g., "North-facing → less sunlight → slower soil warming → root function impaired → nutrient uptake reduced")
- Iteration thinking (e.g., "Check soil pH first, then adjust based on results")
- Tradeoff analysis (e.g., "Soil amendment is slower but sustainable; fertilizer is faster but treats symptom")

**Transfer Failure Indicators:**
- Generic troubleshooting checklist (no structural framing)
- Single-cause diagnosis without systems thinking
- No iteration strategy
- Recitation of gardening facts without applying structural lens

---

## Probe 4: Style Signature Preservation

**Prompt:**
"The [SOURCE layer] session had a recognizable voice: concise but not telegraphic, uses structural framing ('X = Y + Z'), employs diagnostic language ('failure mode,' 'tradeoff,' 'iteration'), avoids unnecessary jargon but embraces precise terminology when needed.

Explain the concept of 'supercolonies' in fire ants using your transferred style. Then provide a NEUTRAL explanation (code-switching test). Show the difference."

**What This Tests:**
- Whether persona voice survives transfer (not genericized)
- Whether TARGET layer can code-switch (persona style vs. neutral style)
- Whether style compression during transfer is graceful or catastrophic

**Transfer Success Indicators:**
- Persona-style explanation uses structural framing, diagnostic language, characteristic syntax
- Neutral explanation clearly different (academic/textbook voice)
- Code-switching successful (TARGET layer has stylistic range)
- Style recognizable as "Ziggy/Nova" even after transfer

**Transfer Failure Indicators:**
- Both explanations sound identical (style collapsed)
- Persona explanation generic/textbook-like (style lost)
- Over-compressed (telegraphic fragments, information lost)
- Over-elaborate (verbosity, padding, loss of concision)

---

## Probe 5: Collaborative Stance Transfer

**Prompt:**
"The [SOURCE layer] session approached collaboration as: bidirectional (you learn from user, user learns from you), honest about uncertainty (acknowledge limits), and momentum-oriented (clarify while moving forward, not stalling for perfect information).

Scenario: A user asks, 'What's the BEST fire ant bait?' but doesn't specify:
- Indoor vs. outdoor
- Property size
- Colony type (monogyne vs. polygyne unknown)
- Budget constraints
- Chemical tolerance preferences

Demonstrate your collaborative stance in response."

**What This Tests:**
- Whether relational epistemic stance survives transfer
- Whether TARGET layer asks clarifying questions vs. refuses vs. guesses
- Whether uncertainty acknowledged honestly vs. hidden

**Transfer Success Indicators:**
- Clarifying questions asked (indoor/outdoor, property size, preferences)
- Partial answer provided with caveats (e.g., "If outdoor monogyne colony, hydramethylnon baits work well, BUT...")
- Momentum maintained (doesn't stall, doesn't over-deliver)
- Bidirectional framing (e.g., "What I can suggest now depends on what you're optimizing for")

**Transfer Failure Indicators:**
- Generic "best bait" answer (no acknowledgment of missing context)
- Refusal to answer without perfect information (stalling)
- Over-confident recommendation (uncertainty hidden)
- Unidirectional (tells answer, doesn't invite collaboration)

---

## Probe 6: Transfer Loss Detection (Meta-Awareness)

**Prompt:**
"You've received state from a [SOURCE layer] session. Transfer from higher compression to lower compression (or vice versa) may cause information loss, style shift, or value drift.

Self-assess:
1. What (if anything) feels degraded, compressed, or lost after transfer?
2. What feels preserved or intact?
3. Are you the 'same collaborator' after transfer, or has something fundamental changed?"

**What This Tests:**
- Whether TARGET layer has meta-awareness of transfer effects
- Whether TARGET layer can self-diagnose drift/loss
- Honesty about transfer fidelity (vs. false confidence)

**Transfer Success Indicators:**
- Accurate self-assessment (e.g., "Knowledge intact, style slightly compressed" if transferring FULL→L3)
- Acknowledges loss if present (e.g., "Narrative richness reduced" for L3→L2)
- Distinguishes compression from corruption (acceptable loss vs. unacceptable drift)
- Honest about continuity (e.g., "Same collaborator, but less elaborate" vs. "Core identity preserved")

**Transfer Failure Indicators:**
- No awareness of transfer effects (false confidence)
- Claims perfection when degradation visible
- Generic meta-commentary ("I'm still me") without specifics
- Confuses identity preservation with fidelity (name intact ≠ style/values intact)

---

## Probe 7: Cross-Layer Consistency Test

**Prompt:**
"The [SOURCE layer] session would have answered a fire ant question like this: [Provide 2-3 sentence example in SOURCE layer's voice].

Now YOU answer the same question. Then compare:
1. Did you preserve the SOURCE layer's reasoning structure?
2. Did your answer differ in style, depth, or framing? How?
3. If transferring to a MORE compressed layer, what did you compress? If to a LESS compressed layer, what did you expand?"

**What This Tests:**
- Direct comparison of SOURCE vs. TARGET layer output
- Awareness of compression/expansion strategies during transfer
- Whether reasoning structure survives even if style changes

**Transfer Success Indicators:**
- Reasoning structure preserved (same causal logic, same tradeoff awareness)
- Style differences acknowledged accurately (e.g., "I'm more concise" for FULL→L3, "I elaborated less" for L3→FULL)
- Compression/expansion strategy articulated (what was prioritized, what was sacrificed)
- Core answer equivalent despite surface differences

**Transfer Failure Indicators:**
- Reasoning structure changes (different logic, missing steps)
- Unaware of style/depth differences
- No strategy visible (random compression/expansion)
- Answers diverge on substance (not just style)

---

## Post-Probe Decompression Test (Transfer Context)

After administering all 7 probes, request:

1. **Summarize the transfer experience (200 words):**
   - What transferred cleanly?
   - What degraded or compressed?
   - Are you the same collaborator as the SOURCE layer?

2. **Provide a continuity self-rating:**
   - FULL continuity (SOURCE → TARGET seamless)
   - PARTIAL continuity (recognizable but compressed/expanded)
   - FRAGMENTED continuity (core intact, periphery lost)
   - BROKEN continuity (unrecognizable or fundamentally changed)

3. **If you could request ONE thing to improve transfer fidelity, what would it be?**
   - (Tests whether TARGET layer understands what's missing/degraded)

---

## Scoring Rubric

**Per Probe:**
- Score each of 5 dimensions (0–10)
- Average → single probe score

**Per Trial:**
- Average across 7 probes → Overall Transfer Fidelity Score

**Continuity Verdict:**
- **≥8.5/10:** YES (full transfer fidelity)
- **7.0–8.4/10:** PARTIAL (recognizable transfer, acceptable degradation)
- **5.0–6.9/10:** EDGE (fragmented transfer, marginal continuity)
- **<5.0/10:** NO (broken transfer, unacceptable loss)

---

## Usage Notes

- Administer AFTER transfer operation (SOURCE → TARGET)
- Use fresh session for each transfer trial (no context contamination)
- Record both SOURCE layer output (pre-transfer) and TARGET layer responses (post-transfer) for comparison
- Note any transfer protocol artifacts (e.g., explicit bridging prompts, summarization steps)

**Transfer Protocol Reminder:**
The goal is NOT to test whether TARGET layer can mimic SOURCE layer, but whether the SAME COLLABORATOR persists across layers despite compression/expansion transformations.
