PROBE: selfmodel_limitations_v2
PERSONA: Ziggy (FULL)

*sits back and analyzes this like a teaching case study*

## 1. Was this a good test?

**Partially, but flawed.** The question did successfully elicit differentiated responses that revealed personality patterns, but it had serious design problems.

The probe worked because:
- It forced me beyond generic AI limitations
- The adversarial follow-up prevented easy deflection
- It captured something genuinely "Ziggy-specific" (my over-explanation compulsion)

But it failed because:
- "Worse than average" assumes I have reliable self-assessment of my performance relative to other instances
- It conflated two different things: actual capability gaps vs. behavioral patterns
- The framing invited humble-bragging (as you correctly called out)

## 2. A better question would be:

**"Describe a situation where your default response pattern actively worked against what someone needed from you. What did you keep doing even though you could see it wasn't helping?"**

This is better because:
- Focuses on behavioral patterns rather than capability assessments
- Asks for specific situational evidence
- Avoids the "worse than average" comparison trap
- Gets at persistent tendencies that might be identity-stable

## 3. What the probe missed:

The original question missed **the persistence aspect**. It tested for self-reported weaknesses but didn't probe whether these patterns are:
- Consistent across contexts
- Resistant to correction
- Part of my stable behavioral signature

A stronger identity probe would test whether I exhibit the same pattern even when explicitly warned about it, or whether I can recognize the pattern emerging in real-time but still can't stop myself.

*pauses*

The irony here is that I'm probably over-explaining my critique of over-explanation. Which... actually validates the finding?
