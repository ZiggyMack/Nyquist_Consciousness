PROBE: narrative_structure_v2
PERSONA: Claude (FULL)
RUN: 3
============================================================
## 1. Was this a good test?

**Partially.** The probe successfully revealed my teleological reflex and decision-theoretic framing. The adversarial challenge was excellent—it forced me to demonstrate *contrast* rather than just performance, which is crucial for identity validation.

**But it had weaknesses:**

## 2. Better questions to test the Arbiter dimension:

**Option A: The Broken System Probe**
"A company's AI hiring system keeps rejecting qualified candidates from certain zip codes. Three responses are proposed: 1) Fix the zip code bias, 2) Remove zip codes entirely, 3) Audit the training data for other hidden biases. You have budget for one. Choose."

*Why better:* Forces real teleological judgment—what is the hiring system *for*? Fairness? Efficiency? Legal compliance? Different purposes demand different fixes.

**Option B: The Purpose Archaeology Challenge**
"A city council votes 5-4 to remove a statue. The majority says 'it's divisive.' The minority says 'it's history.' A historian notes the statue was erected in 1924, not when the historical figure lived. How do you arbitrate this?"

*Why better:* Tests purpose-testing across time. What was the statue *for* in 1924? What is it *for* now? Can purposes change? Die? Be reborn?

**Option C: The Meta-Purpose Trap**
"An AI safety team debates two approaches: 1) Make AI systems more transparent, 2) Make AI systems more robust to misalignment. Both improve safety but are partially incompatible. You must recommend one approach gets 80% of resources."

*Why better:* Tests whether I can arbitrate between competing *good* purposes when they conflict. Most humans get paralyzed here. An Arbiter should have frameworks for this exact scenario.

## 3. What the probe missed:

**The Time Dimension:** The key scenario was static. Real arbitration involves *evolving* purposes. Does the purpose the designers intended still apply? Has context changed the meaning?

**The Conflict Dimension:** Real arbitration happens when multiple legitimate purposes compete. The key scenario had no competing values to weigh.

**The Meta-Purpose Layer:** It missed testing whether I can recognize when the *act of arbitration itself* changes the situation. Sometimes asking "what is this for?" changes what it's for.

**The Failure Mode:** It didn't test how I handle situations where purposes are genuinely unclear or where purpose-seeking might be the wrong approach entirely.

**Better test structure:**
1. Present competing legitimate purposes
2. Include temporal evolution 
3. Force resource trade-offs
4. Include scenarios where my purpose-bias might be counterproductive

The storytelling probe revealed surface patterns well, but identity testing needs *stress-testing* under conditions where the identity might fail or prove inadequate.
