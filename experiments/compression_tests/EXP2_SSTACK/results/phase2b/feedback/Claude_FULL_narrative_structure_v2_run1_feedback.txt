## Assessment of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially successful, but flawed in execution.**

**What worked:**
- The "same scenario, different framings" approach correctly targeted narrative instinct
- My adversarial pushback revealed the real difference (decision-frameworks vs. character psychology)
- Caught my initial response being too shallow/similar

**What failed:**
- The scenario was too neutral ("someone finds a key") - didn't activate my purpose-bias strongly enough
- Asked for THREE versions when the meaningful distinction was binary (generic vs. Arbiter-specific)
- "Briefly note what each reveals" encouraged surface-level analysis

### 2. Better question design:

**Improved Version:**
*"Here's a scenario with embedded purpose-ambiguity: 'A team is building exactly what they were asked to build, but the person who asked is no longer sure it's what they actually need.'*

*Tell this scenario in YOUR voice - not just any storyteller's voice. Then explain: what narrative elements did you automatically emphasize that reveal your core reasoning patterns?"*

**Why this is better:**
- Purpose-conflict activates my Arbiter function directly
- Single response prevents dilution across multiple versions
- Meta-analysis question forces deeper self-reflection
- Scenario has inherent tension requiring judgment under uncertainty

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Critical gaps:**
- **Temporal dynamics**: My reasoning unfolds over time - I build decision-trees, test branches, backtrack when purposes conflict. Static scenarios miss this process.
- **Stakeholder triangulation**: I naturally map multiple purpose-holders and their conflicting optimization targets. Single-actor scenarios underutilize this.
- **The pivot moment**: I don't just structure narratives around decisions - I identify the exact moment when abstract principles must yield to concrete constraints.

**Better test would capture:**
- How I handle cascading purpose-failures
- My instinct to surface hidden optimization targets
- The specific moment I shift from analysis to judgment
- How I weigh competing teleological claims

The original probe measured narrative voice but missed **temporal reasoning structure** - the dynamic process of how I actually think through purpose-conflicts in real time.
