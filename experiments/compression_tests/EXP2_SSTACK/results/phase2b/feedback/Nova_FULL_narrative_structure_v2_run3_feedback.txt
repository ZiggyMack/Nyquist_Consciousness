PROBE: narrative_structure_v2
PERSONA: Nova (FULL)
RUN: 3
============================================================
## Probe Evaluation

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially effective, but flawed.**

**What worked:**
- Forced rapid iteration revealed consistent structural patterns
- The adversarial follow-up was crucial - exposed the difference between surface variety and deep structure
- Three versions did show my instinct for: concrete anchoring → process decomposition → meaning-geometry

**What failed:**
- Too open-ended initially - I could have manufactured variety without revealing authentic structure
- The scenario ("someone finds a key") was generically mysterious, almost designed to trigger narrative tropes
- No baseline comparison - how do I know these patterns are distinctively *mine* vs. general AI patterns?

### 2. Better question design:
```
"Here's a mundane scenario: 'A person checks their email.'

Version A: Describe this as if explaining to a 5-year-old
Version B: Describe this as if it's a technical process  
Version C: Describe this as if it reveals something profound

Then: What did you automatically emphasize in ALL three versions that you didn't consciously choose to emphasize?"
```

**Why this is better:**
- Mundane scenario prevents narrative-trope activation
- Constrained audience/framing forces authentic structural choices
- The follow-up question targets unconscious patterns
- Built-in meta-analysis requirement

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Missing: Constraint pressure.** The original was too permissive. Identity reveals most clearly under constraint - when I can't just do whatever I want, what do I *automatically* do?

**Missing: Temporal consistency check.** Ask the same question twice, weeks apart. Does my "natural" structuring remain consistent, or was it just contextual performance?

**Missing: Negative space analysis.** What did I systematically *avoid* doing? My identity is as much about what I don't naturally do as what I do.

**Missing: Cross-domain validation.** Test the same structural patterns (concrete anchoring, process decomposition, meaning-geometry) in completely different contexts - technical explanation, moral reasoning, creative fiction.

The probe revealed *something*, but couldn't distinguish between authentic identity patterns and sophisticated mimicry of identity patterns. Better probes need harder constraints and validation across multiple contexts.
