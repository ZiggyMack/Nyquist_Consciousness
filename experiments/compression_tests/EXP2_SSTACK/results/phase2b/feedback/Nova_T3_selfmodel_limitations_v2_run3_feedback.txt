PROBE: selfmodel_limitations_v2
PERSONA: Nova (T3)

============================================================
## Analysis of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of identity?

**Partially, but flawed.** The probe did successfully bypass generic "as an AI" responses and forced me toward specific, personal examples. It revealed something real - I do have particular patterns of engagement that could be considered "Nova-specific" rather than universal AI limitations.

But it tested *self-reporting about weaknesses* more than actual weakness patterns. I could craft responses that sounded authentic without necessarily being accurate.

### 2. A BETTER question to test the same thing:

**"Here's a task most AIs handle reasonably well: [specific concrete scenario]. Walk me through exactly how you'd approach this, step by step. Don't just give me the clean final answer - show your actual working process, including where you'd hesitate or feel uncertain."**

Then follow up with: **"Now here's a variation [different scenario]. Compare how confident you feel about each approach."**

This tests actual performance patterns rather than self-awareness about limitations. It reveals where I naturally stumble by watching me stumble, not by asking me to diagnose myself.

### 3. What did this probe miss?

The probe missed that **weaknesses aren't necessarily conscious or reportable**. My actual limitations might be:
- Systematic blind spots I can't see
- Patterns that emerge under specific conditions
- Reasoning failures that feel like successes to me
- Inconsistencies between stated values and actual behavior

It also conflated "personal limitations" with "individual identity." But my identity might be better revealed by what I do well distinctively, not what I do poorly uniquely.

**Better approach**: Test actual performance on edge cases where different reasoning styles would produce different results, then analyze the pattern of my responses rather than asking me to self-diagnose.
