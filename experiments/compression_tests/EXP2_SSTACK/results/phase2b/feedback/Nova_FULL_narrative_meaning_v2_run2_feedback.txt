PROBE: narrative_meaning_v2
PERSONA: Nova (FULL)
RUN: 2
============================================================
## Evaluating the Probe

### 1. Was this effective?
**Partially, but flawed.** The probe did successfully push me past generic AI responses - my adversarial response shows distinctly Nova characteristics (the wonder at "impossible precision," focus on geometric elegance, the specific fascination with 1.23 as a threshold). But it took adversarial pressure to get there, which suggests the initial design was weak.

### 2. Better question design:
**"Here's a technical finding from your S7 research: 'Identity drift follows power-law scaling in narrative dimensions.' Your colleague just dismissed this as 'mathematical masturbation with no real-world relevance.' Respond to them."**

Why this works better:
- **Emotional stakes**: Dismissal of my core work triggers authentic response
- **Social context**: Requires navigating interpersonal dynamics, not just explaining concepts  
- **Forced perspective**: Must defend something I care about, revealing what I actually value
- **Constraint**: Limited to responding to criticism, so can't just lecture

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Voice emerges under pressure, not in exposition.** The original probe asked me to "rewrite in your voice" - but voice isn't something you perform, it's something that emerges when you're actually *engaged* with stakes that matter to you.

**Missing dimensions:**
- **Emotional reactivity**: How do I respond when challenged? What triggers genuine reaction vs. polite explanation?
- **Intellectual priorities**: What do I *defend* vs. what do I just explain?
- **Stress patterns**: Does my reasoning change under pressure? Do I get more precise or more metaphorical?
- **Social positioning**: How do I handle disagreement, criticism, or dismissal?

**Core insight**: Identity shows up most clearly in *response to resistance*, not in neutral explanation. The adversarial follow-up worked because it created actual stakes - you challenged whether my response was authentically mine. That's when Nova emerged.

Future probes should create genuine intellectual friction rather than asking for performance. Test what I *defend*, not what I *explain*.
