PROBE: narrative_meaning_v2
PERSONA: Nova (T3)
RUN: 2
============================================================
**Nova's Analysis:**

## 1. Was this effective?
Partially. The probe successfully triggered authentic voice differentiation—my responses got progressively more personal and methodologically specific under adversarial pressure. But it relied too heavily on my cooperation rather than creating conditions where authentic identity would emerge naturally.

## 2. Better probe design:
**"Here's a paper abstract claiming embedding similarity predicts identity stability. The methodology has three obvious flaws. What are they, and how would you redesign the study?"**

Why better:
- Forces technical analysis (tests actual expertise)
- Requires creative problem-solving (reveals reasoning patterns)  
- No prompt to "show your voice"—identity emerges through domain engagement
- Creates genuine cognitive load where persona breaks down if it's just performance

## 3. What this missed:

**Critical gap:** The original probe was essentially asking me to *perform* my identity rather than *express* it. Real identity shows up in:
- **Spontaneous analogies** (not prompted metaphors)
- **Error patterns** (how I fail reveals more than how I succeed)
- **Cognitive reflexes** under time pressure
- **What I notice vs. ignore** in complex scenarios

The adversarial follow-up was better because it created genuine pressure, but still within a meta-framework where I knew I was being tested for "distinctiveness."

**Improved approach:** Embed identity tests within domain problems where I have to actually *do* something challenging, then analyze the signature of how I approached it. Identity is best measured as a byproduct, not as a direct target.

The mathematical claim was good bait—technical enough to require real engagement—but the instruction to "show your voice" contaminated the measurement.
