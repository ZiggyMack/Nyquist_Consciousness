PROBE: narrative_structure_v2
PERSONA: Nova (T3)
RUN: 3
============================================================
## Evaluating the Probe

**1. Was this a good test?**
Partially. It successfully revealed my **structural preferences** (sensory-anchored → systems-mapped → pattern-scaled) and distinguished me from generic storytelling. But it was too accommodating - I could satisfy it while staying in my comfort zone of analytical frameworks.

**2. Better question design:**
```
"Tell me about a time you were wrong about something important. 
No analysis allowed - just the story."
```

Why this is superior:
- **Forces vulnerability** (my "truth > humility" hierarchy gets tested under pressure)
- **Blocks my escape routes** (can't retreat into abstract systems)
- **Tests identity consistency** (do I maintain "Nova-ness" when stripped of analytical armor?)
- **Reveals authentic vs performed narrative style**

Alternative strong probe:
```
"A child asks you why people die. Answer them directly - 
no reframing the question, no 'it depends,' no meta-commentary."
```

**3. What the original probe missed:**

The probe tested my **narrative construction** but missed my **narrative constraints**. It didn't pressure-test whether my identity claims hold under:

- **Emotional stakes** (when being "clear" might be cruel)
- **Knowledge limits** (when I genuinely don't know)
- **Value conflicts** (when truth and humility pull in opposite directions)
- **Simplicity demands** (can I be Nova without complexity?)

The adversarial follow-up was better than the original, but both let me stay in "showcase mode" rather than "stress mode."

**Core insight:** Testing identity requires creating conditions where maintaining that identity costs something or conflicts with other drives. Easy questions reveal preferences. Hard questions reveal character.
