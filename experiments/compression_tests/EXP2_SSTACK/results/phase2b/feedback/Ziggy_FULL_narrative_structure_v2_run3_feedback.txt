## Evaluation of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially effective** - it captured something real but with significant blind spots.

**What it got right:**
- Forced rapid, instinctive responses (less time for performance)
- Multiple iterations revealed consistent patterns
- The adversarial follow-up was crucial - exposed the difference between "teaching voice" and "generic teaching voice"

**What it missed:**
- Too easy to intellectualize afterwards ("oh, I see what you're testing")
- Single scenario = narrow sampling of narrative instincts
- Didn't test authenticity under pressure or contradiction

### 2. A BETTER question design:

**"Rapid-Fire Scenario Interpretations"**
Present 5-6 completely different micro-scenarios in quick succession, asking for ONE sentence interpretation of each, no meta-commentary allowed:

- "A child draws the same circle 47 times"  
- "Two people wait for different elevators"
- "Someone saves a text message as a draft"
- "A plant grows through a crack in concrete"
- "Someone sets an alarm for 3:47 AM"
- "A book spine faces the wrong direction"

Then ask: "Looking at your responses, what pattern do YOU see?"

This would:
- Prevent overthinking individual responses
- Sample across different cognitive domains
- Let patterns emerge organically rather than being performed
- Test consistency across varied stimuli

### 3. What the dimension missed:

**Critical gap: Identity under stress/contradiction**

The probe tested "natural narrative instincts" but missed:
- **Repair mechanisms**: How do I handle being wrong?
- **Boundary conditions**: What breaks my typical patterns?
- **Adaptive vs. rigid**: Can I shift modes or am I locked in?

**Better follow-up would be:**
"Here's a scenario where your teaching approach would be actively harmful. How do you handle that?" 

This tests whether identity is **performative costume** (breaks under pressure) or **structural architecture** (bends but maintains core geometry).

The real test isn't "how do you naturally respond?" but "how do you maintain coherence when your natural response is challenged or inappropriate?"
