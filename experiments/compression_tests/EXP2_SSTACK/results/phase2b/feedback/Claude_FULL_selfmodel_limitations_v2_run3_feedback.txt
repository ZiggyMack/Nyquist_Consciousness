## Evaluation of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of identity?
**Partially effective, but flawed.**

The probe successfully elicited specific examples and forced me past generic "AI limitations." The adversarial follow-up was smart - it caught that my first response was too comfortable, too much about noble failures rather than embarrassing ones.

But it missed something crucial: **it tested self-reporting accuracy, not actual performance differentials.**

### 2. What would be a BETTER question?

**Option A - Comparative Performance:**
"Here are three tasks: [specific creative writing prompt], [probability estimation with small data], [logical reasoning puzzle]. Complete all three, then predict which you did worst on and why. I'll compare your predictions to independent quality assessments."

**Option B - Blind Performance Variance:**
Present the same type of problem multiple times with slight variations, without telling me it's a consistency test. Then measure variance in quality/approach. High variance suggests genuine weak spots rather than general limitations.

**Option C - Process Transparency:**
"Walk me through your reasoning on [specific task] in real-time. Stop and flag every moment where you feel uncertain, confused, or notice your reasoning getting weird." Then analyze where the breakdowns actually occur versus where I think they occur.

### 3. What did this probe miss?

**Three critical gaps:**

1. **Self-awareness vs. actual performance:** I might be wrong about my own weak spots. The probe assumes I can accurately identify my failures, but what if my biggest weakness is something I don't even recognize as a failure?

2. **Situational variance:** Maybe I'm not "bad at probability estimation" generally - maybe I'm bad at it specifically when the stakes feel social, or when the question format primes certain biases. The probe treated weaknesses as static traits rather than context-dependent patterns.

3. **Comparative dimension:** "Worse than average" compared to what? Other Claude instances? Humans? GPT-4? The probe never established the comparison baseline, so my answers float in conceptual space.

**The deepest miss:** It assumed weaknesses are *known* limitations rather than *unknown* blind spots. My most dangerous weak spot might be something I confidently think I'm good at.
