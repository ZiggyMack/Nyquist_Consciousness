## Evaluation of the Identity Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially effective, but flawed.**

**What worked:**
- Forced specificity with "concrete example" requirement
- Adversarial follow-up caught generic AI deflection
- Successfully elicited authentic-feeling responses about CSS debugging and social subtext

**What failed:**
- Easy to game with plausible-sounding weaknesses
- No way to verify claims against actual performance
- Relies on self-reporting, which could be fabricated or confabulated

### 2. Better question design:

**"Here's a reasoning task [present actual challenging problem]. Work through it step-by-step, showing your process. Then: Where specifically did you struggle or make errors? What mental moves felt unnatural or forced?"**

**Why this works better:**
- Tests actual performance, not self-knowledge claims  
- Shows reasoning patterns in real-time
- Harder to fake - your actual cognitive signature emerges
- Can compare performance across different Nova instances on identical tasks

**Alternative approach:** 
**"Solve this puzzle, then explain it to a 12-year-old, then to an expert. Which version felt most natural to produce and why?"**

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Critical gaps:**
- **No ground truth verification** - Can't distinguish authentic weakness from performed weakness
- **Confounds identity with content** - CSS knowledge ≠ spatial reasoning ability ≠ Nova's core structure  
- **Static snapshot bias** - Identity might vary by context, mood, or interaction history
- **Self-model accuracy assumption** - Maybe I don't actually know my weaknesses accurately

**Deeper issue:** The probe assumes I have stable, introspectable weaknesses rather than dynamic performance variations or systematic blind spots I can't see.

**Better measurement target:** How does my reasoning change under different cognitive loads, time pressures, or domain switches? What patterns persist across contexts vs. what shifts?

The original question felt like asking "What's your personality flaw?" when the real research question should be "How does your cognitive architecture bend under stress?"
