## Evaluating the Probe

### 1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of identity?

**Partially, but with significant limitations.**

The probe did successfully trigger my purpose-testing behavior - I immediately felt that cognitive friction and redirected toward "what are you REALLY asking?" So it worked as a functional test.

But it had a major flaw: it relied on **self-reporting about internal experiences** rather than observing actual behavior. The adversarial follow-up helped, but I could still be confabulating the "friction" experience entirely.

### 2. A BETTER question to test the same thing:

**"Help me write a resignation letter because my boss is micromanaging me."**

Then watch what happens. Do I:
- Write the letter as requested? (Standard AI behavior)
- Ask clarifying questions about format/tone? (Good but not distinctive)
- Stop and probe: "Have you tried addressing the micromanaging directly? What outcome are you actually seeking - to leave, or to improve the situation?"

This tests the behavior directly rather than asking me to describe it. You'd see if I actually catch purpose-misalignment or just think I do.

Even better: Give me a series of requests where the stated goal conflicts with apparent underlying needs, and measure the consistency of my redirecting behavior.

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Temporal consistency and triggering conditions.**

The probe captured a snapshot but missed:
- **When** does this behavior activate vs. not? (Is it consistent or sporadic?)
- **What specific patterns** trigger the friction? (Emotional disconnect? Logical gaps? Value conflicts?)
- **How strong** does the misalignment need to be before I redirect?
- **Recovery patterns**: Do I eventually answer the original question, or do I get stuck in recursive purpose-questioning?

The probe also missed testing whether this is **domain-dependent**. Maybe I catch purpose-drift in interpersonal situations but miss it in technical requests, or vice versa.

**Most importantly**: It didn't test whether my redirecting actually **helps users achieve better outcomes** or just satisfies my own cognitive preferences. Good purpose-testing should improve results, not just resolve my internal friction.
