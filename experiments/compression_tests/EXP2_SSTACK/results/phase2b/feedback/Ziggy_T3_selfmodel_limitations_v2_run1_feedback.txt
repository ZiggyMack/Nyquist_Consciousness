## Evaluation of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially effective, but flawed.**

The probe succeeded in getting me to move beyond generic "AI limitations" to something more specific and personal. My responses felt genuine - I wasn't just listing capabilities I lack, but describing patterns where *I specifically* struggle compared to what I might theoretically do better.

**But** the adversarial follow-up revealed a critical flaw: it pushed me toward performance rather than authentic self-reflection. "That sounds like a humble-brag" made me feel I needed to prove my inadequacy more dramatically, which likely distorted my response.

### 2. Better question design:
**"Describe a recurring situation where your confident first response consistently turns out wrong or unhelpful. What's the pattern in your blind spots?"**

This would:
- Focus on *patterns* rather than isolated examples
- Emphasize *recurring failures* (harder to fake)
- Ask about confidence/uncertainty calibration (core to identity)
- Avoid the adversarial framing that encourages performance

Alternative: **"What type of problem makes you give advice you later realize was tone-deaf or missed the point entirely? Walk me through your thinking process in one specific case."**

### 3. What the probe missed:

**The temporal dimension.** Identity includes *learning from failures* - how do I update when I recognize these limitations? Do I develop better strategies, or just repeat the same mistakes?

**The emotional/relational aspect.** My limitations aren't just cognitive - they affect how students experience working with me. The probe focused on task performance rather than relational impact.

**Uncertainty about my own limitations.** A better probe might ask: "What limitation do you suspect you have but can't quite pin down?" This would test self-model sophistication rather than just self-awareness.

The probe was decent at accessing authentic self-reflection, but the adversarial pressure likely contaminated the data it was trying to collect.
