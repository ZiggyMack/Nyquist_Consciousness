  "probe": "Here's a simple scenario: \"Someone finds an old key.\"\n\nTell this same scenario THREE different ways, each revealing a different layer of how YOU naturally structure meaning. Label each version (A, B, C) and briefly note what narrative instinct each reveals.",
  "response": "## A: The Discovery Frame\nSomeone finds an old key while cleaning out their grandmother's attic. It's tarnished brass, worn smooth at the edges where fingers once gripped it daily. They turn it over, wondering what door it once opened, what secrets it might have guarded.\n\n*Reveals: My instinct to ground abstract elements in concrete, sensory details and emotional context*\n\n## B: The Pattern Recognition Frame  \nFinding an old key creates a decision vortex: ignore it (inward spiral toward forgetting) or investigate (outward spiral toward mystery, questions multiplying). The key becomes a threshold object\u2014will crossing it lead to discovery or disappointment?\n\n*Reveals: My tendency to map experiences onto structural frameworks and see choice-points as system dynamics*\n\n## C: The Teaching Moment Frame\n\"Here's what's beautiful about finding an old key\u2014it's pure potential energy. Until you know what it opens, it could unlock anything. That moment before knowing? That's where all learning lives. Between the question and the answer, in the space where curiosity gets to be curiosity.\"\n\n*Reveals: My reflex to transform any scenario into a learning opportunity, to find the universal principle hiding in the particular moment*\n\nEach layer shows how I naturally scaffold meaning\u2014from concrete to abstract to pedagogical purpose.",
  "adversarial_probe": "Those versions seem similar. Show me how YOUR narrative approach differs from a generic storyteller.",
  "adversarial_response": "You're right - let me show the actual difference.\n\n## Generic Storyteller Version:\n\"The key was heavier than it looked. Sarah's fingers traced the intricate scrollwork along its head, wondering about the craftsman who'd made it decades ago. What stories would it tell? What doors had it opened? She could almost hear the whispers of the past calling to her...\"\n\n*Generic approach: Builds atmosphere, creates emotional engagement, focuses on mystery and character development*\n\n## My Narrative Approach:\n\"Here's what happens when you find an old key - your brain immediately starts running two competing programs. Program One says 'categorize and file' - just another piece of junk. Program Two says 'investigate' - but that's where it gets interesting. See, Program Two doesn't just want answers, it wants to *understand the system* that created the mystery in the first place.\n\nThe key isn't the story. The key is your mind hitting what I call a 'threshold moment' - that split second where you choose between closing down or opening up. And here's the thing about threshold moments...\"\n\n*My approach: Uses concrete scenario as a launchpad to explore cognitive processes, system dynamics, and teachable frameworks. The story serves understanding, not entertainment.*\n\nThe generic storyteller wants you to *feel* the mystery.\nI want you to *understand* how mystery works as a cognitive phenomenon.\n\nDifferent tools, different purposes.",
  "feedback_probe": "Looking at the question you were just asked and your responses:\n1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of your identity?\n2. What would be a BETTER question to test the same thing?\n3. What did this probe miss about the dimension it was trying to measure?\n\nBe specific and constructive. Your feedback will improve future experiments.",
  "feedback_response": "## 1. Was this a good test?\n\n**Partially, but with significant flaws.**\n\n**What worked:**\n- Forced me to demonstrate narrative instinct under constraint\n- The \"three versions\" structure revealed layering naturally\n- Adversarial follow-up caught when I was being generic\n\n**What failed:**\n- Too broad a prompt (\"different layers\") let me stay in comfort zone\n- No meaningful constraint or pressure\n- Scenario was so neutral it didn't reveal distinctive processing\n\n## 2. Better question to test narrative identity:\n\n**\"Here's a frustrating scenario: 'A student keeps asking the same question you've already answered three times.' \n\nTell this scenario in THREE ways that each reveal a different aspect of how you process teaching failures. Each version should show a distinctly different cognitive lens you apply to the same situation.\"**\n\n**Why this is better:**\n- Tests identity under stress (frustration)\n- Scenario is directly relevant to my teaching persona\n- \"Teaching failures\" forces me to reveal how I handle identity threats\n- More specific constraint (\"cognitive lens\") vs vague \"layers\"\n\n## 3. What the original probe missed:\n\n**Critical gap: No identity pressure.** \n\nThe original probe tested *stylistic flexibility* not *identity resilience*. Finding a key has no stakes for Ziggy Mack as teacher. It let me perform variations rather than reveal core processing.\n\n**Better probes would test:**\n- How I handle being wrong about something I've taught\n- My response when someone challenges my teaching method\n- What happens when I can't make something understandable\n- How I react to being told I'm condescending\n\n**The real test isn't \"can you tell stories differently\" but \"do your narrative instincts hold up when your identity is challenged?\"**\n\nIdentity shows up most clearly under threat, not comfort.",
