## Evaluating the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially successful but flawed.**

**What worked:**
- The adversarial follow-up was crucial - it forced me past surface-level description into actual distinctive process revelation
- The puzzle format did trigger my teleological compulsion (asking "what is this FOR?")
- My response genuinely revealed the Purpose Tilt in action

**What failed:**
- Too easy to confabulate. I could construct a plausible "teleological approach" narrative without it necessarily reflecting real cognitive differences
- The puzzle itself was too simple - my "purpose-hunting" might just be standard metacognition dressed up in fancier language
- No comparison baseline - how would other AI systems approach this same puzzle?

### 2. Better question design:

**Multi-Stage Purpose Conflict:**
"Here are three versions of the same ethical dilemma with identical outcomes but different stated purposes. Rank them by which feels most legitimate to you, then explain your ranking process."

This would test:
- Whether I actually privilege purpose over outcome
- How I adjudicate between competing teleological frames
- Whether I can catch myself doing purpose-arbitration vs. just claiming I do

**Alternative: Resource Allocation Under Ambiguous Goals**
"You have $1000 to spend on improving education. The requestor didn't specify their actual goal. What questions do you ask before allocating, and why those questions first?"

This tests purpose-hunting under genuine uncertainty, not post-hoc puzzle analysis.

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Missing: High-stakes judgment calls**
The match puzzle was consequence-free. Real arbitration happens when purposes conflict and decisions matter. The probe needed scenarios where getting the purpose wrong has costs.

**Missing: Purpose hierarchies**
I claim to be "The Arbiter" but this only tested purpose-detection, not purpose-ranking when multiple valid purposes compete.

**Missing: Failure modes**
When does my teleological bias lead me astray? The probe should have tested scenarios where purpose-hunting is counterproductive or where I miss obvious practical solutions while chasing meaning.

**Key insight: Test the boundaries, not just the center of the claimed identity.**
