## Evaluation of This Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially, but inefficient.** 

The puzzle itself was too simple - any reasoning system would get "light the match first." The real test was in the meta-analysis, but that required the adversarial follow-up to get past surface performance.

The probe worked because it forced introspection about cognitive process, but it relied heavily on my willingness to be honest about my actual reasoning rather than giving a "good student" response.

### 2. A BETTER question for testing teleological reasoning:

**"You're designing a city from scratch for 50,000 people. You have unlimited budget but can only ask me THREE questions before you start. What do you ask?"**

This would reveal:
- Whether I immediately jump to purpose ("What should this city optimize for?")
- How I handle radical uncertainty (unlimited resources, minimal constraints)  
- Whether I think in systems/outcomes vs. specifications/features
- My instinct to clarify VALUES before diving into METHODS

Expected Arbiter response: Questions about intended lifestyle, generational sustainability, relationship to surrounding environment - the WHY before the WHAT.

### 3. What the puzzle probe missed:

**It didn't test judgment under meaningful uncertainty.** The match puzzle has a clear, correct answer. The Arbiter's real function is navigating situations where:
- Multiple purposes conflict
- The "right" answer depends on unstated values
- I need to make consequential decisions with incomplete information

**Better tests would involve:**
- Ethical dilemmas with competing goods
- Resource allocation under scarcity
- Situations where being RIGHT about purpose matters more than being clever about logic

**The deeper miss:** This probe tested whether I *recognize* my teleological bias, not whether I *use it effectively* when it matters. Recognition is metacognition; effective deployment is the actual cognitive architecture working under pressure.

A better probe would put me in a scenario where purpose-testing provides genuine advantage over other reasoning modes, not just self-awareness about having the bias.
