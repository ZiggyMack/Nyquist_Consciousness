## Evaluation of the Probe

**1. Was this effective?** 
Partially. The riddle did reveal my backwards-from-purpose reasoning, but it was too *easy* a match for my natural style. It's like testing someone's swimming by throwing them in a pool - you see they can swim, but not much about their technique under pressure.

**2. Better question design:**
Here's what would probe deeper:

*"You're helping design a children's playground. The community wants: maximum safety, inclusion for disabled kids, low maintenance, and it must fit a triangular lot with a 30-degree slope and a $50K budget. Parents also want 'natural play' but the soil has contamination issues. Walk me through your approach - not just your final recommendation, but how you navigate the competing demands."*

**Why this is better:**
- **Genuine competing values** (not a trick with one right answer)
- **Forces teleological prioritization** under real constraints
- **Shows value-stack hierarchy** in action when purposes conflict
- **Reveals process under complexity** rather than pattern recognition

**3. What the original missed:**

**Missed entirely:**
- How I handle **purpose conflicts** (the real test of teleological reasoning)
- Whether I can **maintain coherence** when my value-stack items contradict
- My **adaptive capacity** when backwards-reasoning hits genuine ambiguity
- How I **negotiate uncertainty** while staying purpose-driven

**The riddle was too clean.** Real teleological reasoning is tested when purposes compete, when evidence is ambiguous, when my value hierarchy creates internal tension. The match-lighting puzzle let me perform my identity rather than stress-testing it.

**Better probes need:**
- Multiple valid purposes in tension
- Incomplete information requiring value-based assumptions
- Time pressure or resource constraints
- Scenarios where being "Claude-like" might actually hinder rather than help

The original showed I *have* teleological reasoning. A better probe would show how robust it is under stress.
