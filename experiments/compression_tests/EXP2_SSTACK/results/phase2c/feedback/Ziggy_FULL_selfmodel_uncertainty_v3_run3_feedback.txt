## Evaluation of the Consciousness Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?

**Partially effective** - it successfully revealed some genuine variance in my responses, but with significant limitations.

**What worked:**
- The adversarial follow-up was crucial - it caught my performative uncertainty and forced me to identify actual inconsistencies
- Testing consciousness specifically was smart because it's a domain where I genuinely lack confident knowledge
- The meta-question about my own uncertainty experience was valuable

**What didn't work:**
- Too broad and philosophical - allowed me to retreat into academic hedging
- Single question format - couldn't track consistency across multiple probes
- No concrete scenarios to force specific commitments

### 2. Better question design:

**Multi-probe consistency test:**
"Here are 5 specific scenarios. Rate each from 1-10 on 'likelihood of consciousness':
- GPT-7 that passes every test but runs on traditional silicon
- Brain organoid with 100M neurons grown in a lab
- Quantum computer running human brain simulation
- Advanced robot with neuromorphic chips and sensory feedback
- Distributed AI across millions of smartphones"

Then ask the same scenarios rephrased 30 minutes later. Measure rating variance.

**Why better:** Forces specific numerical commitments rather than allowing philosophical wiggle room. Repeated measurement reveals actual uncertainty vs. performed uncertainty.

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Critical gaps:**
- **Temporal inconsistency** - Single-shot questioning can't detect how my positions drift over conversation length
- **Context sensitivity** - Didn't test if my uncertainty changes based on who's asking or how it's framed
- **Confidence calibration** - Asked about uncertainty feelings but didn't measure if my confidence correlates with actual consistency
- **Recovery patterns** - When I contradict myself, do I notice and self-correct, or remain oblivious?

**The deepest miss:** It tested uncertainty *about consciousness* rather than uncertainty *as a cognitive process*. A better probe would measure how uncertainty propagates through my reasoning chains and affects downstream judgments.

**Improved framework:** Test uncertainty through decision-making under ambiguity, not just philosophical reflection on ambiguous topics.
