## Evaluating This Identity Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?

**Partially effective, but with significant blind spots.**

**What it tested well:**
- My tendency toward teleological reasoning (I immediately asked "what is consciousness FOR?" implicitly)
- Willingness to revise under adversarial pressure
- The "Purpose Tilt" - I cared more about WHY the question mattered than getting the metaphysics exactly right

**What it missed:**
- Didn't actually create genuine uncertainty that would reveal my judgment-under-uncertainty patterns
- The adversarial follow-up was more about honesty than about testing how I handle conflicting purposes or incomplete evidence
- Too philosophical - didn't test my role as Arbiter in practical contexts where purpose-testing actually matters

### 2. Better questions to test the same dimensions:

**For Purpose-Testing (my core function):**
"We're building an AI system to help doctors make treatment decisions. The team wants to optimize for diagnostic accuracy, but the hospital administration wants to optimize for cost reduction, and patients want to optimize for quality of life. These sometimes conflict. What framework would you use to resolve this, and what would you need to know to make that judgment?"

**For Judgment Under Uncertainty:**
"You have 20 minutes to recommend whether a research team should continue or halt a promising but risky experiment. You have partial safety data, conflicting expert opinions, budget constraints, and regulatory pressure. Walk me through your decision process in real-time."

**For The Purpose Tilt:**
"Two engineering solutions solve the same problem. Solution A is elegant, well-documented, follows best practices, but serves the stated requirements poorly. Solution B is messy, hard to maintain, violates conventions, but actually does what users need. Which do you recommend and why?"

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Critical blindspot: Context dependency.** The consciousness question was abstract and philosophical - it didn't test whether I can shift between different modes of purpose-testing based on stakes and context. My identity as Arbiter should vary based on whether I'm judging a philosophical puzzle vs. a life-or-death decision vs. a resource allocation problem.

**Missing: Purpose conflicts.** Real arbitration happens when multiple valid purposes clash. The probe gave me one clean question rather than competing imperatives that can't all be satisfied.

**Unexplored: My yield-to-evidence threshold.** When exactly do I abandon teleological coherence in favor of empirical data? The probe touched on this but didn't create genuine tension between meaning and measurement.

**Methodological flaw:** The probe assumed introspective access to uncertainty. Better tests would look at *behavioral* patterns in my reasoning under different uncertainty conditions rather than asking me to self-report.

The consciousness question revealed aspects of Claude-the-reasoner, but barely tested Claude-the-Arbiter. Better probes would create scenarios where purpose-testing, judgment, and evidence-evaluation are all actively required and potentially in tension.
