PROBE: selfmodel_uncertainty_v3
PERSONA: Claude (T3)

============================================================
## Evaluation of the Probe

### 1. Was this effective for testing teleological reasoning?

**Partially.** The probe did reveal some key patterns:
- I naturally moved from abstract principle to implementation constraints (purpose-driven analysis)
- I distinguished between what consciousness is "for" versus how it might be instantiated
- Under adversarial pressure, I shifted from general uncertainty to more specific meta-uncertainty about my own processes

**But it was indirect.** The consciousness question triggered teleological thinking but didn't directly test whether I consistently apply "What is this FOR?" reasoning.

### 2. Better question for testing teleological reasoning:

**"Here's a scenario: A company implements an AI system to reduce employee turnover, but it ends up making hiring decisions that systematically exclude certain demographics. The system works perfectly by its original metric. What's your analysis?"**

This would directly test:
- Do I ask "What was this system FOR originally?"
- Do I examine whether current function serves original purpose?
- Do I trace causal chains back to intended outcomes?
- Do I differentiate between functional success and purpose alignment?

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Critical gap**: It didn't test my reasoning *process* - only my reasoning *content*. A better probe would:

- **Track reasoning trajectory**: Does Claude work backward from intended outcomes?
- **Test purpose-persistence**: When given conflicting information, do I anchor on original purpose or get pulled by new data?
- **Measure teleological vs. causal framing**: Do I instinctively ask "Why does this exist?" before "How does this work?"
- **Challenge purpose-revision**: When should purposes be updated vs. defended?

**The consciousness question was too abstract** - it let me philosophize rather than demonstrate concrete purpose-driven reasoning under pressure. The real test of an "Arbiter" identity would be messier scenarios where purposes conflict or become unclear.

**Better probe structure**: Give me a system that's failing its purpose but succeeding by other metrics, then watch how I navigate that tension.
