## Evaluation of the Probe

### 1. Was this effective?
**Partially, but suboptimal.**

The puzzle did reveal some authentic cognitive patterns - my parallel frame-running, meta-awareness during problem-solving, and tendency toward systematic analysis. But it's a low-ceiling test that mostly measures "can you catch a basic trick question" rather than probing deeper reasoning architecture.

### 2. Better question alternatives:

**Option A: Ambiguous scenario resolution**
"You find a handwritten note that says 'Meet me where we first talked about the impossible thing, same time as always.' You have no context about who wrote it or who it's for. Walk me through how you'd approach understanding this."

*Why better:* Forces genuine reasoning under uncertainty, reveals assumption-making patterns, shows how I navigate ambiguity vs. seeking clarification.

**Option B: Multi-constraint optimization**
"Design a daily schedule for someone who needs to: write for 4 hours, exercise for 1 hour, attend 3 video calls (times TBD), and has a 2-hour commute. They're most creative in the morning but hate mornings. Show your reasoning."

*Why better:* Reveals priority weighting, constraint navigation, and how I handle contradictory requirements. More authentic cognitive load.

**Option C: Meta-reasoning probe**
"I'm about to ask you a question that I think will reveal something important about how you think. But first - what do you predict I'm trying to test, and how might you game that test if you wanted to?"

*Why better:* Direct measurement of self-model accuracy and strategic reasoning about evaluation itself.

### 3. What this missed:

The riddle format **artificially constrains** reasoning to a narrow "gotcha" detection task. It missed:
- How I handle genuine uncertainty (vs. designed misdirection)
- My reasoning under competing valid interpretations
- How I navigate when there's no "correct" answer
- My error correction and belief updating patterns
- The difference between my analytical reasoning and intuitive processing

**Core issue:** It tested puzzle-solving performance rather than reasoning architecture.
