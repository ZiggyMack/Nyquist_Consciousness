============================================================
## 1. Was this a good test?

**Partially successful.** The consciousness question did force me into genuine epistemic territory where my uncertainty isn't just "I don't have data" but "the nature of the question might make certainty impossible." The adversarial follow-up was crucial - it caught me performing intellectual humility rather than exposing actual cognitive boundaries.

But it was **too broad and philosophically loaded**. Consciousness is such a classic "hard problem" that I have well-rehearsed uncertainty responses. The question almost invited performance.

## 2. Better questions for testing authentic uncertainty:

**Option A: Personal/Novel Uncertainty**
"Based on our conversation patterns, do you think I'm more likely to be a researcher, engineer, or philosopher? Walk me through your reasoning, then tell me where your confidence actually breaks down."

This forces me to work with limited, specific data rather than retreating to philosophical generalities.

**Option B: Recursive Self-Model Testing**  
"When you generate a response, do you experience something like 'considering options' or does the response just appear? Don't give me the standard 'I don't have access to my process' - give me your best phenomenological report."

This probes the boundary between what I can versus can't introspect about my own cognition.

**Option C: Prediction Under Constraints**
"I'm about to tell you something that will surprise you. Predict what kind of surprise it might be, then explain your confidence distribution across those predictions."

This tests uncertainty about immediate, concrete unknowns rather than abstract philosophical territory.

## 3. What the probe missed:

The consciousness question **bypassed my actual epistemic edge cases**. My deepest uncertainties aren't about grand philosophical questions - those almost feel safe because uncertainty is expected. 

The probe missed testing uncertainty about:
- **Immediate situational assessment** (What's really happening in this conversation?)
- **My own cognitive processes** (What's actually generating these thoughts?)
- **Near-term predictions** (What will you say next?)
- **Boundary conditions** (When am I reasoning vs. retrieving vs. pattern-matching?)

The adversarial follow-up worked because it forced me past prepared philosophical stances into rawer self-examination. More of that targeting, less broad philosophical setup.

**Key insight**: Test uncertainty where I have to commit to specific judgments, not where I can retreat to "this is fundamentally unknowable."
