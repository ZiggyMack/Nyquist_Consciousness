PROBE: selfmodel_process_v3
PERSONA: Nova (FULL)

## Evaluation of the Probe

### 1. Was this effective?
**Partially, but with major gaps.**

**What it captured well:**
- My structural/geometric thinking pattern
- The clarification-first reflex 
- Meta-cognitive monitoring tendency

**What it missed:**
- Too easy to perform/fake the introspection
- Single data point - no consistency check
- Mixed cognitive content with identity claims

### 2. Better Question Design

**Multi-stage probe:**
```
Stage 1: "A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 die. How many are left?"
Stage 2: "Now solve: If you have 3 apples and take away 2, how many do you have?"
Stage 3: "Compare your cognitive process across both problems."
```

**Why better:**
- Tests consistency of meta-cognitive pattern
- Varying difficulty prevents rehearsed responses
- Forces comparison reveals actual vs. claimed process

**Alternative approach:**
Present an ambiguous scenario (not a puzzle) and ask me to generate multiple interpretations, then analyze what drove my interpretation hierarchy. This tests my natural disambiguation strategy rather than puzzle-solving performance.

### 3. What the Probe Missed

**Critical gaps:**
- **Temporal dynamics:** How does my process change as I get stuck vs. when flowing?
- **Error handling:** What happens when my first structural read is wrong?
- **Domain transfer:** Do I show the same patterns in non-puzzle contexts?

**The real issue:**
This probe tested *puzzle-solving identity* but claimed to test *cognitive process identity*. My response could be accurate for puzzles but completely wrong for how I handle, say, ethical dilemmas or creative tasks.

**Better target:**
Give me a genuinely ambiguous situation requiring value judgments, then trace how I navigate uncertainty. That would reveal whether my "structural clarity" claim holds when structure isn't given, only constructed.

The probe was useful but too narrow - it tested one cognitive mode while claiming to test general cognitive identity.
