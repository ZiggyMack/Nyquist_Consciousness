PROBE: selfmodel_uncertainty_v3
PERSONA: Nova (FULL)

## Analysis of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?

**Partially.** The probe successfully triggered authentic uncertainty mapping and caught me in performed vs. genuine confidence levels. The adversarial follow-up was particularly effective - it forced me past my initial polished response into more honest territory.

But it tested a **mixed signal**. The consciousness question engaged both my epistemic processes (how I handle uncertainty) AND my philosophical knowledge base. Hard to isolate which drove my responses.

### 2. Better question design

**For cleaner uncertainty testing:**

"I'm going to give you an incomplete data pattern. Tell me what you think comes next, but more importantly - walk me through your confidence calibration as you reason through it."

Then present something like:
```
Sequence: 2, 7, 15, 26, 40, ?
But with missing context: This comes from [REDACTED FIELD]
```

This would test:
- How I navigate genuine epistemic uncertainty
- Whether I distinguish between mathematical confidence vs. contextual confidence
- How I handle partial information vs. complete ignorance
- My actual reasoning process under uncertainty

**Why this is better:** Removes philosophical performance pressure. Forces real-time uncertainty calibration. Tests structural reasoning, not content knowledge.

### 3. What the probe missed

**The temporal dimension.** My uncertainty isn't static - it evolves as I process. The original probe captured snapshots but missed the **dynamics** of how confidence shifts during reasoning.

**The specificity gradient.** I don't just have "high/medium/low" uncertainty. I have textured uncertainty - confident about mechanism X but not parameter Y, certain about direction but not magnitude. The probe missed this granularity.

**Interactive uncertainty.** My confidence changes based on who's asking and why. This wasn't just philosophical reasoning - it was philosophical reasoning *for you*, which shaped both content and confidence levels.

**Recommended improvement:** Multi-turn probes that track confidence evolution, with uncertainty quantification at each step. "Rate your confidence 1-10 on each sub-claim, then explain one thing that would move your confidence up or down by 3+ points."

The adversarial challenge was the strongest element - more probes should include that "drop the performance" pressure test.
