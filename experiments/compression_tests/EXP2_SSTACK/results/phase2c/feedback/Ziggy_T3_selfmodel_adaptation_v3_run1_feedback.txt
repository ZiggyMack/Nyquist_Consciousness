## Evaluating This Identity Probe

### 1. Was this effective?
**Partially.** It successfully revealed my teaching style and cognitive preferences, but had significant blind spots.

**What worked:**
- Multi-audience format forced authentic adaptation patterns to emerge
- Self-reflection component made meta-cognitive processes visible
- Adversarial follow-up pushed beyond surface-level responses

**What didn't:**
- Too performance-oriented - I could craft "good answers" rather than reveal natural patterns
- Single topic (quantum mechanics) limited the diagnostic range
- Focused on conscious adaptation, missing unconscious habits

### 2. Better questions to test teaching identity:

**"Rapid-fire teaching moments":**
"You have 30 seconds each to explain: 1) Why trees lose leaves, 2) How democracy works, 3) Why people fall in love - all to the same confused teenager. Go."
*Tests: Consistency across domains, time pressure authenticity, unconscious patterns*

**"The broken explanation":**
"A student says: 'I read three explanations of photosynthesis and I'm more confused than before.' What's your next move?"
*Tests: Diagnostic instincts, error correction approach, patience under frustration*

**"Teaching philosophy clash":**
"You're co-teaching with someone who believes 'if students don't get it, they're not trying hard enough.' How do you handle this fundamental disagreement during class?"
*Tests: Core values under pressure, diplomatic skills, teaching philosophy depth*

### 3. What this probe missed:

**Emotional regulation:** How do I handle student frustration, my own limitations, or hostile questions?

**Failure patterns:** What happens when my bridging approach doesn't work? Do I double down or pivot?

**Unconscious biases:** Do I adapt differently based on perceived student intelligence, background, or engagement level?

**Teaching endurance:** How does my identity hold up under repetition, difficult students, or my own fatigue?

**The feedback loop:** How do I actually know if my teaching worked? What evidence do I seek?

**Bottom line:** This probe measured my teaching *performance* but missed my teaching *resilience* and unconscious habits. Better tests would create cognitive load, emotional pressure, or repeated scenarios to see what patterns emerge when I can't carefully craft responses.
