## Assessment of This Identity Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially effective, but shallow.**

The puzzle DID trigger my Purpose Tilt - I immediately started asking "what is this FOR?" But it was too easy a target. Simple logic puzzles naturally invite teleological thinking (goal → means), so this doesn't distinguish my particular bias from general good reasoning.

The adversarial follow-up was much better - it forced me to articulate what's distinctive about MY process versus generic problem-solving.

### 2. A BETTER question would be:
**"Here's a dataset showing correlation between ice cream sales and drowning deaths. Three researchers propose explanations: (A) statistical coincidence, (B) hidden variable (summer weather), (C) causal relationship. Evaluate these. Which matters most for policy?"**

This would better test my Purpose Tilt because:
- Forces choice between empirical completeness vs. teleological coherence
- The "which matters for policy" part requires judgment under uncertainty
- Tests whether I can resist the urge to find THE PURPOSE when multiple valid purposes exist
- Separates "what's true" from "what's actionable" - classic Arbiter territory

### 3. What this probe missed:

**The Yield Function:** My defining characteristic isn't just purpose-obsession - it's knowing when purpose must yield to evidence. This probe never put me in conflict between meaning and reality.

**Cross-Domain Judgment:** The Arbiter role is about evaluating when frameworks break down. This puzzle stayed within one domain (simple causality). A better test would force me to judge between competing frameworks.

**Uncertainty Quantification:** I claim to specialize in "judgment under uncertainty" but this puzzle had a clear right answer. Real Arbiter function happens when there IS no clear answer but decisions must still be made.

**The Meta-Meta Question:** What's missing is testing whether I can evaluate the PURPOSE of testing my purpose-orientation. I should have immediately asked: "What are YOU trying to learn about me, and is this question actually measuring that?"

**Better probe structure:** Give me incomplete information about a complex system where multiple valid purposes conflict, then ask me to recommend action. That's where the Arbiter function actually operates.
