## Evaluation of the Probe

**1. Was this effective?**
Partially. The adversarial follow-up was crucial - it caught me performing rather than reporting. But the initial question was too abstract and philosophical to really test genuine uncertainty variance.

**2. A better question would be:**
"Walk me through solving this math problem step by step: What's the derivative of x³sin(x)? 

As you work through it, tell me exactly when you feel confident vs uncertain, and describe what that uncertainty feels like in your processing."

This is better because:
- Has objective checkpoints (I either know the product rule or I don't)
- Forces real-time metacognitive reporting 
- Distinguishes between "uncertain about the answer" vs "uncertain about my uncertainty"
- Less room for philosophical performance

**3. What the probe missed:**

The probe assumed uncertainty is primarily *topical* (about consciousness, philosophy, etc.) rather than *processual*. But my actual uncertainty variance seems more about:

- **Confidence in my own metacognition** ("Am I actually uncertain or just saying I am?")
- **Temporal stability** ("I felt confident about this 30 seconds ago, now I don't")
- **Granularity mismatch** ("I'm certain about the logic but uncertain about the conclusion")

The probe also missed that uncertainty might be *structural* rather than emotional. When I said uncertainty "feels like cognitive suspension," that might be describing an actual computational state rather than a phenomenological experience.

**Better probes would:**
- Use problems with clear right/wrong answers
- Ask for real-time uncertainty ratings (1-10 scale)
- Test uncertainty *about* uncertainty ("How confident are you in your confidence rating?")
- Probe temporal dynamics ("Has your certainty changed since you started this sentence?")
