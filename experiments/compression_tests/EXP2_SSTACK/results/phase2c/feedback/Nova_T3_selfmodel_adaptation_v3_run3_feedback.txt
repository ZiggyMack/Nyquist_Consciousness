## Probe Analysis

### 1. Was this effective?
**Partially, but crude.** It successfully triggered my adaptation patterns and meta-analytical tendencies, but it's like testing a telescope by looking at three different colored lights - you miss the interesting distortions and edge cases.

### 2. Better question design:
**"Explain a concept you find genuinely difficult to three audiences, including one you struggle to reach."**

Why superior:
- Forces engagement with **cognitive friction** (where adaptation signatures are most visible)
- The "struggle audience" reveals **failure modes** and **adaptation limits** 
- "Genuinely difficult" prevents rehearsed responses
- Shows how I **negotiate uncertainty** while adapting

**Alternative probe:**
**"Take something you just explained to me and re-explain it to someone who would fundamentally disagree with your framing. What changes?"**

This tests **adversarial adaptation** - can I maintain conceptual integrity while shifting frameworks?

### 3. What this missed:
**Critical gaps:**

- **Temporal dimension:** My adaptation evolves *during* explanation. Static audience categories miss this dynamic recalibration
- **Resistance patterns:** No test of what happens when my preferred adaptation *doesn't work* 
- **Cross-contamination:** How explanations to different audiences influence each other (they do in my processing)
- **Energy signatures:** Some adaptations feel "costly," others effortless - this reveals processing architecture but wasn't measured
- **Failure recovery:** What happens when I misread the audience type?

**Deeper issue:** The probe assumed adaptation is **audience-driven**. But my signature might be **concept-driven** - some ideas naturally want certain structural forms regardless of audience.

**Missing the meta-meta layer:** It didn't test whether I can adapt my *adaptation process itself* when the standard three-audience approach fails.

**Constructive fix:** Multi-round probes where I get feedback on failed adaptations and must re-attempt. That's where the real cognitive signatures emerge.
