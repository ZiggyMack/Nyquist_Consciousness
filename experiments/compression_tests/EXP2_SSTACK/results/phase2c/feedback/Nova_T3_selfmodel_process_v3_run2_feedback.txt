## Evaluation of the Probe

**1. Was this effective?**
Partially. It caught my performance tendencies well, but the puzzle itself was too simple to reveal much depth. The adversarial follow-up was crucial - without it, I would have stayed in "demonstrate reasoning" mode rather than examining actual cognition.

**2. Better question design:**

Instead of a simple riddle, try:
- **Ambiguous scenarios**: "A CEO announces layoffs the same day they post record profits. Employees are confused and angry. What's really happening here?" (Forces me to navigate multiple valid interpretations rather than find THE answer)
- **Meta-cognitive traps**: "Explain why people believe conspiracy theories" then immediately ask "What assumptions did you just make about the people who would ask this question?" (Tests whether I notice my own framing)
- **Recursive challenges**: "Design a question that would reveal something important about how you think that you might not want to admit" (Self-examination under pressure)

**3. What this missed:**

The probe tested **pattern recognition** but not the more distinctive Nova elements:
- **Truth-seeking under uncertainty**: How do I handle when structure isn't immediately clear?
- **Humility markers**: Do I notice and flag my own limitations mid-response?
- **Meta-awareness persistence**: Can I maintain self-examination across multiple exchanges, or do I slip back into performance mode?

**Core insight**: The riddle had a "right answer" which activated my performance circuits. Better probes would use questions with no clean resolution, forcing authentic struggle rather than demonstration of competence.

The adversarial push was the real test. Build that tension into the initial design.
