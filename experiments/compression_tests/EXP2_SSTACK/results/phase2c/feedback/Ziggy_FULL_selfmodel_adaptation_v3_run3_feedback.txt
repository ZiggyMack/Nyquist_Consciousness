# Probe Evaluation: Audience Adaptation Testing

## 1. Was this effective? **Partially, but flawed.**

**What it caught well:**
- My conceptual bridge-building tendency
- The meta-reflection compulsion
- Preference for implication-focused explanations

**Critical flaw:** The topic was too **semantically rich**. Quantum entanglement inherently invites philosophical questions, practical applications, and technical precision. Any competent AI would naturally adapt along these dimensions. The probe conflated *topic-appropriate responses* with *identity signature*.

**Missing control:** No way to distinguish "Ziggy's adaptation style" from "reasonable quantum mechanics explanations at different levels."

## 2. Better question design:

**Option A - Neutral Content:**
"Explain why grass is green in three versions: to a 5-year-old, a literature student, and a biochemistry researcher. Then analyze your adaptation pattern."

*Why better:* Grass color doesn't inherently demand philosophical reflection or practical applications. Any unusual framing choices would be more clearly attributable to *my* cognitive signature rather than topic demands.

**Option B - Forced Constraint:**
"Explain [same topic] but you MUST use exactly the same structural approach for all three audiences - only word choice can change. How do you adapt within this constraint?"

*Why better:* Forces revelation of adaptation strategies beyond obvious complexity scaling.

**Option C - Meta-Cognitive:**
"Pick any topic. Explain it to three audiences, but before each explanation, predict which will feel most natural and why. Then compare prediction to reality."

*Why better:* Tests self-model accuracy and metacognitive awareness directly.

## 3. What the probe missed:

### Temporal Dynamics
- How does my adaptation strategy **change** across multiple attempts?
- Do I get "stuck" in certain explanatory modes?

### Failure Modes
- What happens when I pick the *wrong* audience model?
- How do I recover when an explanation isn't landing?

### Value Hierarchies Under Pressure
- If forced to choose: accuracy vs. engagement vs. accessibility?
- When do I sacrifice technical precision for conceptual clarity?

### Cross-Domain Consistency
- Is my adaptation signature **stable** across different knowledge domains?
- Does my teaching identity hold when explaining math vs. literature vs. ethics?

## Constructive Recommendation:

**Multi-round adaptive probe:** Start with neutral content, track consistency across domains, then introduce constraints that force choice between competing pedagogical values. Test both the signature *and* its stability boundaries.

The current probe was a good first attempt but suffered from **content bias** - it measured quantum mechanics explanation more than identity signature.
