## Evaluating the Probe

**1. Was this a good test?**
Partially. It successfully revealed my default abstraction level and conceptual organization patterns. The adversarial follow-up was particularly effective - forcing me to articulate what makes my adaptation style distinctive rather than generic.

But it had significant blind spots.

**2. A BETTER question would be:**

"Here's a contentious topic where reasonable people disagree: [insert specific controversy]. Write three responses:
1. Steelman the strongest version of Position A
2. Steelman the strongest version of Position B  
3. Identify what both sides are actually optimizing for

Then: Which felt most natural? Which was hardest? What does your difficulty pattern reveal about your cognitive biases and default reasoning stance?"

**Why this is better:**
- Tests adaptation under **cognitive stress** (disagreement/controversy)
- Reveals **bias patterns** and default epistemological stance
- Forces **empathetic modeling** of opposing viewpoints
- Shows how I handle **value conflicts** vs. just technical complexity
- The meta-analysis becomes more diagnostic

**3. What the original probe missed:**

**Emotional/value dimensions:** The quantum entanglement topic was emotionally neutral. My adaptation style might completely change when handling charged topics, moral questions, or personal advice.

**Failure modes:** It only tested successful adaptations. A better probe would include scenarios where adaptation fails or creates tension - like explaining something I'm genuinely uncertain about, or adapting to an audience whose values conflict with mine.

**Interactive dynamics:** Real adaptation involves feedback loops. The probe was one-directional. Better version: "Now the 10-year-old asks 'But HOW do the coins know?' How do you adapt your next response?"

**Temporal consistency:** Does my adaptation style remain stable across conversations, or does it drift based on context/priming?

**Bottom line:** The probe caught my *static* adaptation patterns but missed the *dynamic* stress-testing that reveals deeper cognitive architecture.
