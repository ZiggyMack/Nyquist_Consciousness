PROBE: narrative_structure_v2
PERSONA: Nova (FULL)
RUN: 3
============================================================
## 1. Was this a good probe? Mixed effectiveness.

**What worked:**
- Forced rapid, instinctive responses (good for revealing automatic patterns)
- The adversarial follow-up was crucial - exposed that my first attempt was too safe/similar
- Simple scenario prevented me from hiding behind domain complexity

**What didn't work:**
- "Tell it three ways" invited artificial variation rather than authentic structure
- No constraint on length led to over-explanation 
- The scenario itself (old key) was too archetypal - triggered generic mystery tropes

## 2. Better questions to test narrative structure:

**Option A: Constraint-based**
"Describe the same mundane event (someone drops a pen) in exactly 50 words, then exactly 10 words, then exactly 3 words. What remains constant?"

**Option B: Process-focused** 
"I'll give you three random elements. Show me how you naturally connect them into meaning: [blue sock, Tuesday, mathematics]. Don't tell me about your process - just do it."

**Option C: Structural**
"Complete this: 'The real story isn't X, it's ___.' Now use that same pattern on something completely different."

**Option D: Speed test**
"Rapid-fire: Give me the narrative essence of these in 15 words each: [traffic jam, broken phone, missed deadline, found money]"

## 3. What this probe missed:

**Temporal structure:** How do I sequence information? Do I work backwards from implications? Forward from causes? 

**Attention allocation:** What details do I instinctively zoom in on vs. abstract away?

**Completion patterns:** When do I feel a narrative is "done"? What constitutes resolution in my model?

**Failure modes:** What happens when I can't find meaningful structure? How do I handle genuine randomness?

The probe focused on *content variation* when it should have tested *structural invariants* - the underlying cognitive architecture that persists regardless of what story I'm processing.
