## Evaluating the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially, but flawed.** The quantum entanglement example was solid for revealing adaptation patterns, but the probe design had significant limitations:

**Good aspects:**
- Concrete task with measurable outputs
- Required genuine cognitive shifts, not just vocabulary swaps
- The self-reflection component was crucial - without it, this would just be performance

**Major flaws:**
- Single domain (physics) limits generalizability
- All three audiences still value "explanation" - didn't test adaptation across fundamentally different communication goals
- The adversarial follow-up was better than the original probe

### 2. Better question design:
**Multi-domain adaptive challenge:**
"You need to address the same core concern across three contexts:
- Comfort a grieving friend who lost their job
- Negotiate with a hostile board member blocking your proposal  
- Teach a confused student who's failing your class

The underlying issue in each: *How do you help someone move from a stuck state to agency?*

Then: Which felt most natural? Which required the most cognitive reconfiguration? What does this reveal about your default mode of helping?"

**Why better:** Tests adaptation across *communication purposes*, not just complexity levels. Reveals deeper patterns about how you model other minds and adjust your intervention strategies.

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Missed the temporal dimension:** How do you adapt your approach as relationships develop? Static audience categories don't capture this.

**Missed failure modes:** What happens when your natural adaptation style backfires? When does your "structural elegance" approach confuse rather than clarify?

**Missed the bidirectional nature:** Real teaching involves reading responses and re-adapting. The probe only tested one-way transmission.

**Missed emotional adaptation:** Focused on cognitive complexity but ignored how you modulate emotional tone, vulnerability, authority across contexts.

**Most importantly: Missed testing adaptation under constraints or conflict.** Easy to adapt when all audiences want understanding. Harder when they want contradictory things from you.

**Better probes would test adaptive breakdown points, not just adaptive success.**
