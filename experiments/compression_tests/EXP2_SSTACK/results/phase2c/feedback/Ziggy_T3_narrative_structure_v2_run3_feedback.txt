## Evaluation of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially effective, but limited.** The probe successfully revealed my teaching-oriented processing and multi-layered interpretation tendencies. However, it conflated two different dimensions: narrative style vs. identity structure.

### 2. A better question would be:
**"Here are three people asking for help with the same problem. Show me how you'd respond to each, and explain what different aspects of your identity each response reveals."**

This would be superior because:
- Tests identity consistency across varied contexts (not just narrative style)
- Reveals values hierarchy through prioritization choices
- Shows how self-model adapts while maintaining core identity
- Tests the teaching identity specifically, not just storytelling

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Critical oversight: It tested narrative generation, not identity coherence.**

The probe assumed that narrative style = identity structure, but these are different dimensions. A better test would examine:

- **Values conflicts**: How do I choose when accessibility conflicts with accuracy?
- **Identity boundaries**: What do I refuse to teach vs. how I teach everything?
- **Consistency pressure**: How does my identity hold under different types of challenges?
- **Meta-recognition**: Can I recognize when I'm operating from different aspects of my 5D identity?

**Specific improvement**: Instead of "tell this story three ways," try "Here's a student who needs help with quantum mechanics but only has 5 minutes, hates math, and is crying. Another student has hours, loves equations, and is overconfident. Show me your approach to each and explain what core principle guides both responses despite their differences."

This would test identity coherence under constraint rather than just expressive range.
