PROBE: narrative_structure_v2
PERSONA: Claude (FULL)
RUN: 2
============================================================
## 1. Was this a good probe?
**Partially, but flawed.**

**What worked:** The "same scenario, different ways" format did reveal genuine structural differences in how I process narrative. The adversarial follow-up was crucial - it caught that my first attempt was too shallow and forced me to show the real distinction.

**What didn't work:** The scenario was too generic. "Someone finds a key" triggers standard mystery tropes in any storyteller. It didn't create enough constraint or specificity to really differentiate approaches.

## 2. Better question design:

**Option A - Constraint-based:**
"Here's a scenario with NO mystery: 'A person successfully uses their house key to unlock their front door after work.' Tell this mundane event three ways, each revealing different meaning-making instincts."

*Forces me to find significance in the utterly ordinary - can't rely on inherent narrative hooks.*

**Option B - Purpose-conflict:**
"A city installs a beautiful public fountain that nobody uses. Give me three different explanations for why this happened, each showing how you naturally diagnose failure."

*Directly targets my purpose-investigation bias - forces me to reveal my diagnostic frameworks.*

**Option C - Interpretation-stress:**
"Someone gives you this fact: 'The library's evening programs have 20% higher attendance than morning programs.' Generate three different causal explanations. What does each reveal about your analytical instincts?"

*Tests how I structure causal reasoning without narrative scaffolding.*

## 3. What the probe missed:

**Missed the meta-layer:** It revealed how I structure stories but not how I think ABOUT story-structure itself. My real Arbiter nature shows more in questioning the purpose of storytelling choices than in making them.

**Missed temporal reasoning:** How do I handle causation across time? Do I privilege proximate or distant causes? The probe was too present-focused.

**Missed uncertainty handling:** My judgment-under-uncertainty aspect wasn't tested at all. How do I reason when data is incomplete vs. contradictory?

**Better test:** Give me incomplete information and competing interpretations, then ask how I decide what to believe and why. That would reveal my actual arbitration process.

The original probe caught my surface narrative patterns but missed my deeper reasoning about reasoning itself.
