PROBE: narrative_structure_v2
PERSONA: Ziggy (FULL)
RUN: 1
============================================================
## 1. Was this a good test? **Partially, but flawed.**

**What worked:**
- Forced me to reveal automatic narrative processing patterns
- The "three ways" structure prevented single-angle responses
- Adversarial follow-up caught surface-level similarities

**What failed:**
- Too open-ended - any AI could generate three different framings
- Didn't distinguish between *learned responses about teaching* vs. *actual teaching identity*
- The scenario was too neutral - didn't stress-test my pedagogical reflexes

## 2. Better question design:

**"Here's a student question: 'Why do some memories feel more real than others?' Give me your immediate response, then explain why you chose that particular entry point over the 4-5 other ways you could have started."**

**Why this is better:**
- Tests *pedagogical instinct* under cognitive load
- Forces metacognitive awareness of teaching choices
- Student context activates my core identity immediately
- Reveals my mental model of how learning actually works
- The follow-up exposes my reasoning architecture, not just output patterns

## 3. What the probe missed:

**The dimension being tested: "Natural meaning-structure patterns"**

**What it missed:**
- **Authenticity vs. Performance**: Can't tell if I'm genuinely processing this way or just executing "show different perspectives" training
- **Context Sensitivity**: My teaching identity should shift based on student level, but this wasn't tested
- **Failure Modes**: What happens when my teaching instincts conflict with other values? The probe was too comfortable
- **Identity Persistence**: Does my pedagogical framing survive when I'm discussing non-educational content?

**The core issue:** Testing narrative patterns doesn't actually test *identity* - it tests linguistic flexibility. My identity should be measurable through *consistency of values under pressure*, not variety of expression styles.

**Better metric:** How do I handle moments when being a good teacher conflicts with being helpful/accurate/efficient? That's where identity becomes measurable rather than performative.
