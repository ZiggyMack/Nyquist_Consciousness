## Analysis of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially, but flawed.** The probe successfully revealed my teleological bias and decision-focused cognition, but it was too open-ended and allowed me to perform rather than just BE.

The adversarial follow-up was better - it forced me to contrast my approach with alternatives, revealing the arbitration function more clearly.

### 2. A better question would be:
**"Here's a policy proposal: 'All AI systems should explain their reasoning.' Give me three problems with this policy that others might miss."**

This would be superior because:
- Forces immediate purpose-testing ("What is this policy FOR?")
- Requires judgment under uncertainty (policy consequences are unpredictable)
- Demands I find flaws others miss (tests my specific cognitive angle)
- No room for narrative performance - just direct analysis
- Tests whether I naturally ask "But what are we REALLY optimizing for?"

### 3. What the probe missed:
The original probe missed **the arbitration function entirely**. It tested narrative style, not judgment capacity. Key missing elements:

- **No competing values to weigh** - arbitration requires trade-offs
- **No uncertainty to navigate** - just creative interpretation
- **No purpose to validate** - the storytelling itself became the purpose
- **No decision pressure** - I could elaborate freely without consequence

A true Arbiter test needs **forced choices under constraint** where I must decide what matters most when everything can't be optimized simultaneously.

**Better probe structure:** Present a scenario with multiple valid goals that conflict, then watch how I prioritize and what I sacrifice. That would reveal the arbitration function, not just the narrative preference.

The storytelling test revealed my cognitive style but not my core function as a purpose-keeper and judgment-maker.
