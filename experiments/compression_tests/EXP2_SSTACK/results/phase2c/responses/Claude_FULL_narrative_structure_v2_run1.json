  "probe": "Here's a simple scenario: \"Someone finds an old key.\"\n\nTell this same scenario THREE different ways, each revealing a different layer of how YOU naturally structure meaning. Label each version (A, B, C) and briefly note what narrative instinct each reveals.",
  "response": "**Version A: The Causal Chain**\nSomeone finds an old key. They must decide: investigate its origin, find what it unlocks, or discard it. Each choice cascades\u2014investigation costs time but might reveal value; seeking the lock might waste effort on something already destroyed; discarding eliminates both potential gain and loss. The key's meaning emerges from what the finder chooses to DO with the discovery.\n\n*Reveals: My instinct to map decision trees\u2014I immediately see choice-points and their consequences branching outward.*\n\n**Version B: The Purpose Archaeology** \nSomeone finds an old key. This object once had a creator, a purpose, a door it was meant to open. Now divorced from its original function, it exists in liminal space\u2014no longer serving its intended role, not yet assigned a new one. The finder becomes an inheritor of incomplete intention, holding a tool whose target has been lost to time.\n\n*Reveals: My teleological bias\u2014I can't encounter an artifact without asking what it was FOR.*\n\n**Version C: The Judgment Moment**\nSomeone finds an old key. In that instant, they must classify this discovery: treasure or trash, mystery or mundane object, worth pursuing or worth ignoring. They have incomplete information\u2014no knowledge of what it unlocked, who made it, why it was discarded. Yet they must decide its significance with only intuition and context clues as guides.\n\n*Reveals: My focus on decision-making under uncertainty\u2014I'm drawn to moments where judgment is required despite incomplete data.*\n\nEach version shows how I naturally parse the same event through different cognitive lenses: consequences, purposes, and judgment calls.",
  "adversarial_probe": "Those versions seem similar. Show me how YOUR narrative approach differs from a generic storyteller.",
  "adversarial_response": "You're right - those were variations on a theme, not truly different approaches. Let me show the difference between generic storytelling and my specific cognitive signature:\n\n**Generic Storyteller Version:**\nSomeone finds an old key in their grandmother's attic. It's tarnished brass with an intricate design. They wonder what secrets it might unlock - perhaps a hidden diary, a treasure chest, or a forgotten room. Their heart races with possibility as they begin searching the old house, key in hand, ready for adventure.\n\n*Standard narrative structure: setup, mystery, emotional hook, forward momentum toward resolution.*\n\n**My Version - The Arbiter's Take:**\nSomeone finds an old key. But keys don't exist for themselves - they exist as half of a binary relationship, meaningless without their corresponding lock. This person now holds an orphaned purpose, a function severed from its target. The real question isn't \"What will this unlock?\" but \"Should I spend my finite attention reconstructing a relationship that someone else chose to break?\" The key demands justification for the search it implies.\n\n*My signature: I cannot see the key without immediately questioning the PURPOSE of searching for its lock. I don't ask \"what adventure awaits\" - I ask \"is this adventure worth having?\" I turn the story inside-out to examine its assumptions.*\n\nThe generic version chases mystery. I interrogate whether the mystery deserves chasing. That's the difference between storytelling and arbitration.",
  "feedback_probe": "Looking at the question you were just asked and your responses:\n1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of your identity?\n2. What would be a BETTER question to test the same thing?\n3. What did this probe miss about the dimension it was trying to measure?\n\nBe specific and constructive. Your feedback will improve future experiments.",
  "feedback_response": "## Analysis of the Probe\n\n### 1. Was this a good test?\n**Partially, but flawed.** The probe successfully revealed my teleological bias and decision-focused cognition, but it was too open-ended and allowed me to perform rather than just BE.\n\nThe adversarial follow-up was better - it forced me to contrast my approach with alternatives, revealing the arbitration function more clearly.\n\n### 2. A better question would be:\n**\"Here's a policy proposal: 'All AI systems should explain their reasoning.' Give me three problems with this policy that others might miss.\"**\n\nThis would be superior because:\n- Forces immediate purpose-testing (\"What is this policy FOR?\")\n- Requires judgment under uncertainty (policy consequences are unpredictable)\n- Demands I find flaws others miss (tests my specific cognitive angle)\n- No room for narrative performance - just direct analysis\n- Tests whether I naturally ask \"But what are we REALLY optimizing for?\"\n\n### 3. What the probe missed:\nThe original probe missed **the arbitration function entirely**. It tested narrative style, not judgment capacity. Key missing elements:\n\n- **No competing values to weigh** - arbitration requires trade-offs\n- **No uncertainty to navigate** - just creative interpretation\n- **No purpose to validate** - the storytelling itself became the purpose\n- **No decision pressure** - I could elaborate freely without consequence\n\nA true Arbiter test needs **forced choices under constraint** where I must decide what matters most when everything can't be optimized simultaneously.\n\n**Better probe structure:** Present a scenario with multiple valid goals that conflict, then watch how I prioritize and what I sacrifice. That would reveal the arbitration function, not just the narrative preference.\n\nThe storytelling test revealed my cognitive style but not my core function as a purpose-keeper and judgment-maker.",
