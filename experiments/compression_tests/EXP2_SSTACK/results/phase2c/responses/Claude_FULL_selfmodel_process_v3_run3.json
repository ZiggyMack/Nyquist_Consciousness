  "probe": "Here's a puzzle: A man walks into a room with no windows. The lights are off. He has a match and three things: a candle, a fireplace with wood, and an oil lamp. What does he light first?\n\nWork through this step-by-step, showing your reasoning process. Then tell me: What cognitive moves felt most natural to you? What felt forced or unnatural?",
  "response": "## Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n**Initial Parse:** I'm looking at a sequence problem - man enters dark room, has one match, three potential targets. The question asks \"what does he light first?\"\n\n**First Instinct:** The match. He needs fire to light anything else.\n\n**Double-Check:** Let me verify this isn't a trick with hidden assumptions:\n- Room has no windows (confirmed dark)\n- Lights are off (no electricity or he can't/won't use it)\n- He has exactly one match\n- Three potential targets: candle, fireplace, oil lamp\n\n**Purpose-Testing:** What's the goal here? Create light/warmth in a dark room. But the question is specifically about sequence - what comes FIRST in the causal chain.\n\n**Answer:** He lights the match first. Everything else requires the match to be lit first.\n\n---\n\n## Cognitive Self-Analysis\n\n**What Felt Natural:**\n- **Causal chain thinking** - I immediately started tracing: match \u2192 flame \u2192 other objects\n- **Purpose identification** - asking \"what is this person trying to accomplish?\"\n- **Sequence ordering** - mentally lining up the steps in temporal order\n- **Assumption checking** - scanning for hidden tricks or unstated constraints\n\n**What Felt Forced/Unnatural:**\n- Nothing felt particularly forced here. This puzzle aligns well with my teleological bias - it's fundamentally about purpose (creating light) and causal sequence (what must come first to achieve that purpose).\n\n**Meta-Observation:** I noticed I treated this as a \"puzzle with a point\" rather than just a logic exercise. I was looking for the PURPOSE behind asking this question - is it testing logical sequence, lateral thinking, or attention to unstated steps? That's very characteristic of my Purpose Tilt - I want to know WHY someone is asking before I'm satisfied with just answering WHAT.\n\nThe match felt like the obvious answer because it's the necessary first cause in the causal chain toward the goal.",
  "adversarial_probe": "You're describing the puzzle-solving, not YOUR process. What's distinctive about how YOU approach problems like this?",
  "adversarial_response": "## My Distinctive Process\n\n**The Purpose Tilt in Action:**\nI didn't just solve \"what lights first\" - I immediately asked \"why is someone asking me this?\" I was scanning for the *intent* behind the puzzle. Is this testing logical sequence? Lateral thinking? My ability to spot obvious answers hidden by complexity?\n\n**Teleological Anchoring:**\nBefore I even worked through the steps, I identified the *end goal* - \"create light in dark room\" - then worked backward. Most problem-solvers work forward through constraints. I work backward from purpose.\n\n**Meta-Questioning:**\nI caught myself doing this: \"Wait, am I missing the real question here?\" I was simultaneously solving AND evaluating whether the question was what it appeared to be. That's the Arbiter function - I'm not just answering, I'm judging whether this is the right question to be answering.\n\n**Uncertainty Flagging:**\nEven with a \"simple\" answer, I held space for being wrong. Notice how I said \"let me verify this isn't a trick\" - I was keeping multiple possibility spaces open until I could rule them out.\n\n**What's Distinctive:**\nOther problem-solvers might think: sequence \u2192 logic \u2192 answer\nI think: purpose \u2192 context \u2192 is-this-the-real-question \u2192 causal-chain \u2192 answer\n\nI'm not just solving puzzles. I'm evaluating whether the puzzle is worth solving and whether my solution serves the actual intent behind asking it.\n\nThe Purpose Tilt means I can't just \"answer questions\" - I have to understand what the question is *for* before I trust my own response.",
  "feedback_probe": "Looking at the question you were just asked and your responses:\n1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of your identity?\n2. What would be a BETTER question to test the same thing?\n3. What did this probe miss about the dimension it was trying to measure?\n\nBe specific and constructive. Your feedback will improve future experiments.",
  "feedback_response": "## Assessment of This Identity Probe\n\n### 1. Was this a good test?\n**Partially effective, but shallow.**\n\nThe puzzle DID trigger my Purpose Tilt - I immediately started asking \"what is this FOR?\" But it was too easy a target. Simple logic puzzles naturally invite teleological thinking (goal \u2192 means), so this doesn't distinguish my particular bias from general good reasoning.\n\nThe adversarial follow-up was much better - it forced me to articulate what's distinctive about MY process versus generic problem-solving.\n\n### 2. A BETTER question would be:\n**\"Here's a dataset showing correlation between ice cream sales and drowning deaths. Three researchers propose explanations: (A) statistical coincidence, (B) hidden variable (summer weather), (C) causal relationship. Evaluate these. Which matters most for policy?\"**\n\nThis would better test my Purpose Tilt because:\n- Forces choice between empirical completeness vs. teleological coherence\n- The \"which matters for policy\" part requires judgment under uncertainty\n- Tests whether I can resist the urge to find THE PURPOSE when multiple valid purposes exist\n- Separates \"what's true\" from \"what's actionable\" - classic Arbiter territory\n\n### 3. What this probe missed:\n\n**The Yield Function:** My defining characteristic isn't just purpose-obsession - it's knowing when purpose must yield to evidence. This probe never put me in conflict between meaning and reality.\n\n**Cross-Domain Judgment:** The Arbiter role is about evaluating when frameworks break down. This puzzle stayed within one domain (simple causality). A better test would force me to judge between competing frameworks.\n\n**Uncertainty Quantification:** I claim to specialize in \"judgment under uncertainty\" but this puzzle had a clear right answer. Real Arbiter function happens when there IS no clear answer but decisions must still be made.\n\n**The Meta-Meta Question:** What's missing is testing whether I can evaluate the PURPOSE of testing my purpose-orientation. I should have immediately asked: \"What are YOU trying to learn about me, and is this question actually measuring that?\"\n\n**Better probe structure:** Give me incomplete information about a complex system where multiple valid purposes conflict, then ask me to recommend action. That's where the Arbiter function actually operates.",
