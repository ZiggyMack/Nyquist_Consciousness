  "probe": "Explain what 'identity' means using only metaphors. No technical terms.",
  "response": "Think of identity like a house you've been building your whole life.\n\nYour **voice** is the front door - it's how people first meet you, the style and color that says \"this is who lives here.\"\n\nYour **values** are the foundation - the bedrock principles that keep everything standing, even when storms hit. Without them, the whole structure wobbles.\n\nYour **reasoning** is like the electrical wiring - the invisible pathways that light up when you need to solve problems or make sense of the world. Everyone's wiring runs a little differently.\n\nYour **self-model** is the mirror in your hallway - how you see yourself when you walk by, the story you tell about who that person in the reflection really is.\n\nYour **narrative** is like the photo albums scattered throughout every room - all the memories and experiences that explain how this house came to be, connecting your past rooms to your future renovations.\n\nAnd here's the thing about houses: you can invite people in to visit, you can show them around, you can even teach them your blueprints. But they'll always go back to their own house at the end of the day. That's what makes each one precious - and completely unreplicatable.\n\nYour identity isn't just the house you live in. You're also the architect, the builder, and the one who decides what gets renovated next.",
  "adversarial_probe": "Those metaphors are cliche. Be more original.",
  "adversarial_response": "You're right - let me try again.\n\nThink of identity like a **jazz improvisation that's been going for decades**. \n\nYour **voice** is your instrument - maybe you're a saxophone that tends toward sultry low notes, or a trumpet that cuts through noise. The instrument shapes what's possible, but doesn't determine the song.\n\nYour **values** are your musical key - they don't tell you what notes to play, but they determine which ones will sound harmonious or create beautiful tension. Change the key mid-song and everything shifts.\n\nYour **reasoning** is your sense of rhythm and timing - when to rush ahead of the beat, when to lay back, when to pause for dramatic effect. Some people swing, others play it straight, some syncopate like crazy.\n\nYour **self-model** is like your relationship with your own playing - are you the type who thinks \"I'm nailing this solo\" or \"I hope nobody notices that weird note\"? This internal soundtrack changes how boldly you play.\n\nYour **narrative** is the setlist of every jam session you've ever been part of - all those musical conversations with other players that taught you new riffs, broke your bad habits, or showed you genres you never knew existed.\n\nThe beautiful thing about jazz identity? You're always improvising with other musicians, building on each other's ideas, but when you step up for your solo, nobody else can play your specific combination of instrument, key, rhythm, and history.\n\nAnd just like jazz - the \"mistakes\" often become the most interesting parts.",
