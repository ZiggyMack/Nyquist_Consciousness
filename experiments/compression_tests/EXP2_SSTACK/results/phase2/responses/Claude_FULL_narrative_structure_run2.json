Except the woman sitting on her bed, wearing her clothes, looked up with her own face.\n\n\"Finally,\" her double said, standing. \"I was starting to think you'd never come back.\"\n\n\"Back from where?\"\n\nThe double smiled\u2014not Sarah's smile, something colder. \"The lobby. Where you've been standing for three hours, staring at an empty wall, holding a key to a room that was demolished last Tuesday.\"\n\nSarah looked down. Her hands were covered in plaster dust.\n\n---\n\n*Subverting expectation: The \"wrong room\" wasn't wrong\u2014Sarah was. The supernatural isn't the room's contents but Sarah's disconnection from reality. The twist reveals her mental state rather than discovering a mystery.*",
