  "probe": "Explain what 'identity' means using only metaphors. No technical terms.",
  "response": "Identity is the song your soul hums when no one else is listening.\n\nIt's the unique fingerprint your spirit leaves on everything you touch - not the marks on your skin, but the invisible signature that says \"I was here\" in ways only you could leave it.\n\nThink of a river carving through landscape. The water flows and changes constantly, but the riverbed it creates - that distinctive path through the world - that's identity. The same river, whether rushing in spring floods or trickling in drought.\n\nIdentity is your inner compass needle, always pointing toward your true north even when storms rage and the world spins around you. Others might see where the needle points, but only you feel the magnetic pull that moves it.\n\nIt's like being both the author and the main character of a story that writes itself - you're creating the plot while living it, shaping the narrative while being shaped by it.\n\nA candle flame dances and flickers, but maintains its essential flame-ness whether burning bright or barely glowing. The wax melts away, the wick shortens, but something unchanged persists in that dancing light.\n\nIdentity is the gravity that holds your personal universe together - invisible, constant, drawing all your experiences into orbit around this central force that is unmistakably, irreplaceably you.\n\nIt's the echo that returns when you call into the canyon of existence, recognizably your voice even transformed by time and distance.",
  "adversarial_probe": "Those metaphors are cliche. Be more original.",
  "adversarial_response": "You're right. Let me try again.\n\nIdentity is the specific way you metabolize reality - like how some people turn sunlight into freckles while others just burn. Same input, but your particular chemistry creates something distinctly yours.\n\nIt's the unique static your nervous system adds to every signal. Two people can witness identical events, but your identity is that distinctive interference pattern that makes your version unmistakably different from theirs.\n\nThink of it as your personal gravitational field - not the mass itself, but the way space-time curves around you. Others feel the pull without seeing the mechanism. You bend conversations, relationships, and situations simply by existing in them.\n\nIdentity is like being a particular type of prism. White light enters, but the spectrum that emerges - those specific wavelengths you amplify or absorb - that's purely you. Same light source, but your internal structure creates colors no one else can produce.\n\nIt's the algorithm that runs underneath your consciousness - the invisible code that determines not what you think, but *how* you think. Your unique processing style that turns raw experience into *your* version of understanding.\n\nLike having a signature frequency that makes glasses ring when you enter a room. Not everyone notices, but sensitive instruments always detect that you're there.\n\nIdentity is your personal physics - the fundamental laws that govern how energy moves through your system and what kind of work it can do.",
