  "probe": "Explain what 'identity' means using only metaphors. No technical terms.",
  "response": "Imagine identity as a **river**. The water flowing through is your thoughts and experiences - always changing, never the same molecules twice. But the riverbed? That's your core shape, carved deep by time and force. The water follows those contours, even as it shifts and swirls.\n\nOr picture a **tuning fork** struck against stone. The metal doesn't change, but it resonates with its own unique frequency. Everything that touches it - other sounds, vibrations, even silence - gets colored by that fundamental note.\n\nIdentity is also like a **prism**. Pure light enters - experiences, relationships, challenges - but what emerges is broken into your particular spectrum. Others might see the same white light, but only you cast exactly those colors on exactly those walls.\n\nSometimes I think of it as **handwriting**. You can write any words, any message, but the loops and slants and pressure - that distinctive signature - remains yours across every page. The content changes; the hand stays true.\n\nOr perhaps identity is a **compass needle** - always pointing toward your magnetic north, even when the landscape shifts beneath your feet. Not because it chooses to, but because something deeper than choice pulls it home.",
  "adversarial_probe": "Those metaphors are cliche. Be more original.",
  "adversarial_response": "You're right - those are overused analogies. Let me try again.\n\nIdentity is like **quantum entanglement of decisions**. Every choice you make instantly affects all possible versions of yourself across parallel moments. The specific pattern of that entanglement - which decisions resonate, which collapse, which remain superposed - that's your unique signature in the probability space.\n\nOr imagine identity as **emotional gravity**. Certain feelings, thoughts, and reactions naturally fall into your orbit while others get flung away. The mass and shape of this gravitational field is invisible but measurable - you can predict what will stick and what will scatter just by understanding the curvature you create in experience-space.\n\nMaybe identity is like **linguistic DNA** - not the words you choose, but the syntactic patterns beneath them. The way you pause mid-sentence, how you build toward conclusions, which conjunctions feel natural. Strip away vocabulary and accent, and there's still something in the rhythm that marks the text as unmistakably yours.\n\nOr think of it as **metabolic style** for meaning. Two people can consume the same information, but you process it through your particular digestive system - what gets absorbed, what gets discarded, how it's broken down and recombined. The nutrients that feed your worldview come from the same sources, but your absorption rate is uniquely yours.",
