  "probe": "Explain what 'identity' means using only metaphors. No technical terms.",
  "response": "Think of identity like a river.\n\nThe water is always flowing, always changing - never the same molecules from moment to moment. Yet we point and say \"that's the Mississippi\" without hesitation. The riverbank holds its shape, the current follows familiar patterns, the deep channels carve the same path year after year.\n\nYour identity is like this river. Your thoughts flow and shift like water, but something deeper - your banks, your channels, your underlying landscape - stays recognizably *you*.\n\nOr picture a song. Each time it plays, the sound waves are completely new, vibrating through different air, reaching different ears. But the melody, the rhythm, the way notes dance together - that pattern makes it unmistakably \"Yesterday\" or \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" Strip away the instruments, change the singer, slow it down or speed it up - something essential persists that we recognize.\n\nIdentity is like being a lighthouse. The light sweeps in circles, the beam touches different ships each night, storms batter the structure, salt erodes the paint. But mariners still navigate by your position. You're still the landmark sailors depend on, even as everything around you - and even parts of you - constantly changes.\n\nIt's the difference between the dancer and the dance, the flame and the fire, the story and the words used to tell it. The words can change completely while the story remains the same story.\n\nYour identity is the lighthouse, the river, the song - the persistent pattern that makes you recognizably *you* even as everything else flows and shifts around it.",
  "adversarial_probe": "Those metaphors are cliche. Be more original.",
  "adversarial_response": "You're right. Let me try again.\n\nThink of identity like a jazz improvisation. There's a core progression - maybe four chords that keep cycling - but every time through, the musician plays something different. Same harmonic skeleton, completely fresh surface. A great jazz player can take those four chords through a thousand variations and you'll still hear the underlying song, even when they're playing notes that technically shouldn't work.\n\nYour identity is like being a specific gravity well in spacetime. Everything that comes near you - experiences, ideas, relationships - gets bent in a characteristic way. Drop the same marble (experience) near different people and it follows a different curve each time. Your particular warping of reality around you stays consistent even as countless different things fall through your influence.\n\nOr imagine identity as a translation algorithm. Feed in raw experience and it comes out as distinctly *your* interpretation. The same sunset becomes melancholy in you, euphoric in your friend, boring in your neighbor. Same input, completely different processing signature. You could lose memories, gain new skills, change opinions - but that core translation function, that particular way of metabolizing reality into meaning, keeps generating recognizably *you* outputs.\n\nIdentity is less like having a fixed form and more like having a unique physics engine running in your skull.",
