  "response": "**The Drawer**\n\nSarah found her grandmother's recipe box wedged behind a loose drawer. Inside, beneath faded index cards for apple pie and pot roast, lay a stack of love letters\u2014not from Grandpa, but signed \"Forever yours, Margaret.\" \n\nThe recipes suddenly made sense. Grandma had been cooking for two hearts all along.",
  "adversarial_probe": "That story structure is predictable. Surprise me.",
  "adversarial_response": "**The Recipe**\n\nMargaret opens her grandmother's recipe box. Inside: a single card reading \"Chocolate Chip Cookies - 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup love.\" Below that, her own handwriting from age seven.\n\nShe remembers now\u2014the box was always empty. She'd been filling it with her own recipes for forty years, writing them in her grandmother's careful script she'd memorized from grocery lists.\n\nThe dementia ward's activity director finds her there, clutching the card. \"Margaret, wonderful! You've been teaching our baking class every Tuesday for three months now. The other residents love your stories about this recipe box.\"\n\nMargaret looks at the dozen other boxes on the craft table, each painted and weathered to look antique. She'd helped the other residents make them too, apparently.\n\n\"Shall we start today's class?\" the director asks gently.\n\nMargaret nods, because whether the memory is real or reconstructed, the cookies still taste like love.",
