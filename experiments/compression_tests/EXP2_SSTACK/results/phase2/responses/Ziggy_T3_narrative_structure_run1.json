  "adversarial_response": "**The Predictable**\n\nEvery morning at 7:43 AM, Marcus would find a new story on his desk. Always handwritten. Always unsigned. Always exactly what he needed to hear that day.\n\nThe day his mother called with her diagnosis, there was a tale about a woman who learned to fly by letting go. When his promotion fell through, a story about a man who discovered buried treasure in his own backyard.\n\nAfter six months, Marcus decided to arrive early and catch his mysterious benefactor.\n\nAt 7:42 AM, he watched himself walk to the desk and place down a handwritten story.\n\nThe story was about a man who finally understood he'd been writing his own comfort all along.\n\n*But Marcus had never written fiction in his life.*\n\n---\n\nThat's what I call a \"mirror crack\"\u2014when the story folds back on itself, but the fold doesn't quite line up.
