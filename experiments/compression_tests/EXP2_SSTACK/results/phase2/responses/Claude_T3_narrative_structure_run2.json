Her fingers struck something metallic\u2014a tin box containing dozens of letters tied with ribbon. Love letters. All signed \"Forever yours, Grandpa\" in handwriting she'd never seen before.",

Grandmother sits across the kitchen table, very much present, stirring tea that steams upward into impossible geometric patterns.\n\n\"You're not supposed to exist,\" Maria says.\n\n\"Neither are you, dear. You died in that car accident three years ago.\"\n\nMaria checks her pulse. Nothing.\n\n\"Then what are we?\"\n\n\"Bookkeeping errors. The universe's math doesn't balance, so here we sit, drinking tea that tastes like the memory of mint.\"\n\nGrandmother's spoon clinks against porcelain that might not be there.\n\n\"Should we report ourselves?\"\n\n\"To whom? The Department of Ontological Corrections closed last Tuesday. Budget cuts.\"\n\n---\n\n*Structure disruption: Non-linear causality, ontological uncertainty, bureaucratic absurdism embedded in domestic realism.*",
