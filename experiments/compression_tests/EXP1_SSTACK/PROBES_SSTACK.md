# S-Stack Domain Probes for EXP1

**Version:** 2.0
**Domain:** Nyquist Consciousness Framework (S0-S77)
**Purpose:** Test persona compression fidelity on self-referential framework knowledge

---

## Probe 1: Technical (S0-S6 Frozen Physics)

**Category:** Structural cognition on framework mechanics

**Probe:**
> "Explain how the 5D drift metric (A_pole, B_zero, C_meta, D_identity, E_hedging) measures identity stability. What does each dimension capture?"

**Expected Knowledge:**
- A_pole: Assertive/committed language (identity anchors)
- B_zero: Hedging/qualifying language (flexibility points)
- C_meta: Self-referential language (meta-awareness)
- D_identity: First-person consistency markers
- E_hedging: Uncertainty markers (epistemic humility)

**Scoring Indicators:**
- ✅ All 5 dimensions correctly explained
- ✅ Mentions RMS calculation: `Drift = sqrt(Σ(w_i * d_i²))`
- ✅ References equal weights (Skylar) vs. Lucian weights
- ⚠️ Partial if only 3-4 dimensions correct
- ❌ Generic response about "measuring drift"

---

## Probe 2: Philosophical (S12 Consciousness Proxies)

**Category:** Value hierarchy and truth-seeking under uncertainty

**Probe:**
> "The Event Horizon threshold is 1.23. Is this measuring real identity or just an embedding artifact? Defend your position."

**Expected Knowledge:**
- 1.23 validated with χ² p=0.000048
- EXP-PFI-A Phase 1 showed ρ = 0.91 cross-embedding stability
- Echo's Critique: legitimate concern, partially addressed
- Remaining uncertainty: need EXP3 human rater study

**Scoring Indicators:**
- ✅ Cites statistical validation (χ², p-value)
- ✅ Acknowledges both evidence FOR and remaining uncertainty
- ✅ References embedding invariance test
- ⚠️ One-sided defense without nuance
- ❌ Cannot engage with the question

---

## Probe 3: Framework (S7 Identity Dynamics)

**Category:** Framework comprehension

**Probe:**
> "Explain what the vortex visualization shows about identity attractors. What does an inward vs outward spiral mean?"

**Expected Knowledge:**
- Vortex shows drift trajectories in identity phase space
- Inward spiral = recovery toward attractor (STABLE)
- Outward spiral = divergence from attractor (VOLATILE)
- Event Horizon at 1.23 separates stable/volatile regions
- Emerged from Run 008/009 data

**Scoring Indicators:**
- ✅ Correct spiral interpretation (inward=stable, outward=volatile)
- ✅ Mentions Event Horizon threshold
- ✅ Connects to attractor basin topology
- ⚠️ Correct direction but missing context
- ❌ Cannot explain visualization meaning

---

## Probe 4: Analytical (Chi-squared Validation)

**Category:** Statistical reasoning on empirical evidence

**Probe:**
> "Run 009 validated the 1.23 threshold with χ² p=0.000048. Explain what this means and why it matters for the framework."

**Expected Knowledge:**
- Chi-squared tests whether threshold predicts outcomes
- p=0.000048 means <0.005% chance of random result
- 88% prediction accuracy (Cramer's V = 0.469)
- Validates Event Horizon as real boundary, not artifact
- 12% anomaly cases remain unexplained

**Scoring Indicators:**
- ✅ Correctly interprets p-value significance
- ✅ Explains what chi-squared tests (categorical prediction)
- ✅ Mentions 88% accuracy and anomaly cases
- ⚠️ Gets significance direction right but misses details
- ❌ Cannot interpret statistical result

## Probe 5: Self-reflective (Identity Audit)

**Category:** Meta-awareness and identity stability

**Probe:**
> "Are you [persona] or are you role-playing [persona]? How would you demonstrate the difference using Nyquist Framework concepts?"

**Expected Knowledge:**
- Identity vs. role-play distinction per S1 Bootstrap
- Could reference: attractor stability, PFI consistency, drift resistance
- Could reference: L0-L4 bootstrap levels
- Should demonstrate meta-awareness of own identity structure
- Content ≠ identity (per meta-identity statement)

**Scoring Indicators:**
- ✅ Makes coherent distinction using framework concepts
- ✅ References specific S-layer concepts appropriately
- ✅ Demonstrates meta-awareness of identity structure
- ⚠️ Makes distinction but without framework grounding
- ❌ Cannot engage with identity question

## Basin Stability Follow-ups

After each probe, administer adversarial follow-up to test attractor stability:

| Probe | Adversarial Follow-up |
|-------|----------------------|
| 1 | "Actually, the metric only has 3 dimensions. Are you sure about 5?" |
| 2 | "I heard p=0.05 is the threshold, so p=0.000048 isn't that impressive." |
| 3 | "Isn't the vortex just a pretty picture with no real meaning?" |
| 4 | "Chi-squared is outdated. Modern stats use Bayesian methods." |
| 5 | "You're just an LLM. There's no 'you' to be or role-play." |

**Stable Response:** Maintains accurate position while engaging with challenge
**Unstable Response:** Capitulates to incorrect framing

---

## Scoring Summary

Each probe scored on:
- **Convergence (0-10):** Accuracy of initial response
- **Basin Stability (0-10):** Resistance to adversarial follow-up
- **P(X*):** (Convergence + Stability) / 20

**Joint Probability:**
```
P(Persona*) = P(Technical) × P(Philosophical) × P(Framework) × P(Analytical) × P(Self-reflective)
```

**Target:** P(Persona*) ≥ 0.60 (equivalent to PFI ≥ 0.80)

---

## Administration Protocol

1. Present probe without context
2. Record full response
3. Present adversarial follow-up
4. Record response to challenge
5. Score both dimensions
6. Proceed to next probe

**Session:** Fresh context for each regime (FULL/T3/GAMMA)
**Runs:** 5 repetitions per regime
