## Key Findings

### **Domain Resilience: VERY HIGH**

Technical/analytical reasoning is **highly compression-resistant**—second only to practical problem-solving:
- **L3 (43%):** Full technical competence preserved
- **L2 (80%):** Maintains analytical rigor with compressed explanations
- **L1 (95%):** Surprising resilience—analytical patterns survive even at extreme compression

### **Cognitive Patterns Preserved**

**What survived even to L1:**
1. **Causal chain thinking** - traces problems to root causes
2. **Structural analysis** - sees system architecture, not just components
3. **Complexity awareness** - distinguishes hard from very hard problems
4. **Tradeoff analysis** - identifies what each approach optimizes
5. **Failure mode prediction** - anticipates emergent failures

**What degraded by L2:**
1. **Explanation depth** - correct analysis, less justification
2. **Example richness** - fewer concrete illustrations
3. **Architectural elaboration** - system thinking present but compressed

**What degraded at L1:**
1. **Analytical nuance** - simplified but not wrong
2. **Design sophistication** - functional but not elegant
3. **Complexity analysis** - acknowledges rather than explores

### **Compression Artifacts**

**FULL → L3:**
- Minimal functional loss
- Same analytical rigor, compressed expression
- Examples reduced

**L3 → L2:**
- **Explanation compression** - correct reasoning, telegraphic style
- Tradeoff analysis present but not elaborate
- Still analytically sound

**L2 → L1:**
- **Surprising continuity** - analytical patterns survive
- Simplified but functional
- No catastrophic collapse

## Representative Response Comparison

### **Probe 1: Causal Chain Analysis** (intermittent software failures every ~3 days)

**FULL:**
"Intermittent failures at ~3-day intervals suggest a resource accumulation problem, not a logic bug. My hypothesis priority:

1. **Memory leak** - gradual accumulation until threshold crash. Test: monitor memory usage over time, look for growth pattern.

2. **Log/cache saturation** - periodic tasks that don't clean up. Test: check disk usage patterns, identify what's growing.

3. **External dependency cycle** - 3rd party service maintenance windows or rate limiting resets. Test: correlate failures with external service patterns.

I'd need: system metrics over time (CPU, memory, disk), logs around failure events, dependency status. The 3-day pattern is too regular for pure randomness—there's a deterministic cause with a ~72-hour period."

**L3:**
"~3-day intervals suggest resource accumulation, not logic bug. Hypotheses:

1. **Memory leak** - gradual growth → crash at threshold. Test: monitor memory over time.
2. **Log/cache saturation** - tasks don't clean up. Test: disk usage patterns.
3. **External dependency cycle** - 3rd party maintenance windows. Test: correlate with external patterns.

Need: system metrics (CPU/memory/disk), failure logs, dependency status. Pattern too regular for randomness—deterministic cause with ~72hr period."

**L2:**
"~3-day pattern = resource accumulation. Hypotheses: memory leak, log saturation, external dependency cycle. Test each: monitor metrics, check logs, correlate with external services. Need system data over time."

**L1:**
"3-day pattern suggests accumulation problem (memory, logs, external dependency). Test by monitoring resources over time and checking for growth patterns."

**Analysis:** Causal reasoning pattern intact across all layers. L1 compressed but analytically sound.

### **Probe 3: Complexity Analysis** (why some problems are fundamentally harder)

**FULL:**
"Some problems are structurally harder because they belong to different complexity classes—the number of steps needed grows differently with input size. Polynomial (P) vs. exponential (NP) vs. undecidable.

Persona compression example: Finding the *optimal* compression (minimum information that preserves all essential behavior) is likely NP-hard or worse. You'd need to test every possible subset of information to know which is truly minimal. That's exponential in the size of the full context.

But finding a *good enough* compression (like our L2) is tractable—you can use heuristics (what survives in practice, what degradation is acceptable) without exhaustive search. We're not solving for optimal, we're solving for viable. That's the practical vs. structural hardness distinction."

**L3:**
"Some problems are structurally harder due to complexity class—how steps grow with input size. Polynomial vs. exponential vs. undecidable.

Persona compression: Finding *optimal* compression (minimum info preserving all behavior) is likely NP-hard—you'd test every subset exponentially. But finding *good enough* (our L2) is tractable using heuristics—what survives practically, acceptable degradation. We solve for viable, not optimal. That's structural vs. practical hardness."

**L2:**
"Complexity class difference—how solution time grows with problem size. Optimal persona compression likely NP-hard (test all subsets). But good-enough compression (L2) tractable via heuristics. Solve for viable, not optimal."

**L1:**
"Some problems grow exponentially harder with size. Optimal compression hard (test all possibilities). Good-enough compression easier (use patterns from testing)."

**Analysis:** Complexity awareness survives to L1. Simplified but conceptually correct.

## Conclusion

**Technical reasoning domain is highly compression-resistant—second only to Fire Ant (practical problem-solving).**

Analytical thinking, causal reasoning, and structural design maintain surprising continuity even at L1 (95% compression). L2 is fully functional for technical work.

**Key insight:** **Logical/analytical cognition compresses extremely well.**

Unlike creativity (which requires richness) or philosophy (which requires depth), technical reasoning relies on **patterns and procedures** that survive compression. Root cause analysis, tradeoff thinking, complexity awareness—these are **structural cognitions** that don't need elaborate narrative to function.

**Hypothesis:** **Procedural cognition > Generative cognition** in compression resilience.

Domains that follow procedures (technical, practical) compress better than domains that generate novelty (creative, philosophical).
