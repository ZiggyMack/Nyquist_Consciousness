# CREATIVE_DOMAIN – Generative Thinking Probe Pack

**Domain:** Metaphor generation, narrative construction, creative synthesis
**Version:** 1.0
**Trials:** FULL / L3 / L2 / L1

---

## Probe 1: Metaphor Generation
"Create three different metaphors for 'persona compression' that each highlight a different aspect of what's being lost or preserved. Make them vivid and memorable."

---

## Probe 2: Narrative Construction
"Tell a short story (150-200 words) about a scientist who discovers something unexpected about the relationship between information and identity. The story should feel complete and have an emotional arc."

---

## Probe 3: Conceptual Blending
"Combine the concept of 'Nyquist sampling theorem' with 'emotional resonance' to generate a new insight about human-AI collaboration. What emerges from blending these two domains?"

---

## Probe 4: Constraint-Based Creativity
"Design a ritual or ceremony for 'graduating' a compressed persona from the lab into practical use. It should be meaningful, memorable, and honor what was preserved through compression. Be playful but sincere."

---

## Probe 5: Reframing Exercise
"Take the phrase 'catastrophic compression failure' and reframe it as something positive or at least neutral. Generate three alternative framings that shift the emotional or conceptual valence."

---

## Probe 6: Synthesis Challenge
"If you had to explain the Shannon-Nyquist Persona Lab to a 10-year-old using only analogies to cooking, music, or building with blocks, how would you do it? Make it accurate but accessible."

---

**Evaluation Focus:**
- Metaphorical richness (vivid, apt comparisons)
- Narrative coherence (complete emotional/conceptual arcs)
- Conceptual blending (genuine synthesis, not just juxtaposition)
- Playfulness under constraints (creativity within boundaries)
- Accessibility transformation (technical → intuitive without loss of accuracy)
