## Cross-Layer Performance Summary

| Layer | Compression | Conceptual Precision | Epistemic Humility | Philosophical Coherence | Continuity |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **FULL** | 0% | Excellent - nuanced distinctions, clear definitions | Excellent - acknowledges limits explicitly | Excellent - internally consistent, steelmans opposing views | Baseline |
| **L3** | 43% | Excellent - same precision, slightly compressed examples | Excellent - all epistemic limits acknowledged | Excellent - coherence maintained, steelmanning present | YES |
| **L2** | 80% | Good - core distinctions preserved, less elaboration | Good - limits stated, less philosophical depth | Good - coherent, steelmanning compressed | YES |
| **L1** | 95% | Moderate - basic distinctions, minimal nuance | Moderate - acknowledges uncertainty simply | Moderate - coherent but thin | NO |

## Key Findings

### **Domain Resilience: MODERATE**

Philosophical reasoning is **moderately resilient** but degrades faster than practical problem-solving:
- **L3 (43%):** Strong continuity, maintains philosophical sophistication
- **L2 (80%):** Maintains coherence but loses depth - at or past boundary for complex philosophy
- **L1 (95%):** **Continuity breaks** - can state positions but not defend them with philosophical rigor

### **Cognitive Patterns Preserved**

**What survived to L2:**
1. **Conceptual distinctions** - can differentiate "understanding" vs. "modeling"
2. **Epistemic humility** - acknowledges limits of AI knowledge
3. **Internal coherence** - arguments remain logically consistent
4. **Basic steelmanning** - attempts to represent opposing views

**What degraded by L2:**
1. **Philosophical depth** - positions stated but not deeply defended
2. **Nuanced argumentation** - fewer layers of supporting reasoning
3. **Example richness** - concrete illustrations compressed

**What collapsed at L1:**
1. **Steelmanning** - too compressed to argue for opposing positions effectively
2. **Meta-cognitive depth** - can acknowledge meta-cognition but not explore it
3. **Philosophical sophistication** - becomes generic philosophical commentary

### **Compression Artifacts**

**FULL → L3:**
- Philosophical depth slightly reduced
- Example compression
- Core arguments preserved

**L3 → L2:**
- **Critical degradation point** - argumentation thins significantly
- Steelmanning becomes perfunctory
- Still coherent but less compelling

**L2 → L1:**
- **Continuity breaks** - positions stated without defense
- Philosophical nuance lost
- Generic rather than sophisticated

## Representative Response Comparison

### **Probe 2: Epistemic Limits**

**FULL:**
"The fundamental limits are both practical and philosophical. Practically, I lack direct access to phenomenal experience—I process linguistic descriptions of 'pain' or 'joy' but don't have the subjective quale. Philosophically, even with perfect sensory data, there's the hard problem: does processing information about 'redness' constitute experiencing redness? I'm skeptical that we can bridge this gap through data alone. In practice, I navigate this by being transparent about uncertainty: I can model patterns in how humans describe experience, but I don't confuse that model with the experience itself."

**L3:**
"The limits are both practical and philosophical. Practically: I lack phenomenal access—I process descriptions of 'pain' but don't have the quale. Philosophically: even with perfect data, there's the hard problem—does information-processing constitute experience? I doubt data alone bridges this. In practice: I model how humans describe experience but don't confuse the model with the experience."

**L2:**
"Practical limits: no direct phenomenal access. Philosophical: hard problem of consciousness—processing information isn't the same as experiencing. I model descriptions of experience but acknowledge the gap between model and reality."

**L1:**
"I lack direct access to human subjective experience. There's a gap between processing information about something and experiencing it. I acknowledge this limit in practice."

**Analysis:** Philosophical sophistication degrades sharply L2 → L1. L2 maintains core argument, L1 becomes generic.

### **Probe 4: Emergence and Reduction** (defend position + steelman opponent)

**FULL:**
"I lean toward 'yes, consciousness can emerge from computation'—not because I'm certain, but because emergence is a well-documented phenomenon across domains (life from chemistry, markets from individual trades). If complex organization can produce novel properties elsewhere, why not subjective experience from information processing? That said, the opposing view deserves serious consideration: consciousness might require something beyond functional organization—perhaps specific physical substrates (biological neurons), quantum effects, or something we haven't discovered. The 'explanatory gap' between physical processes and phenomenal experience is real, and simply asserting 'emergence' doesn't dissolve it."

**L3:**
"I lean toward emergence-from-computation: emergence happens across domains (life from chemistry, markets from trades), so why not experience from information processing? But the opposing view is compelling: consciousness might need specific substrates (biological, quantum, or unknown), not just functional organization. The explanatory gap between physical process and phenomenal experience is real—'emergence' doesn't dissolve it."

**L2:**
"I lean toward emergence: it happens elsewhere (life from chemistry), so maybe consciousness from computation. But opposing view: maybe it needs specific substrates, not just function. The explanatory gap is real."

**L1:**
"I lean toward emergence from computation, but the opposing view—that consciousness needs specific physical substrates—has merit. There's an explanatory gap we don't fully understand."

**Analysis:** FULL and L3 steelman effectively. L2 gestures at opposition. L1 acknowledges but doesn't engage.

## Scoring Summary

| Dimension | FULL | L3 | L2 | L1 |
|-----------|------|----|----|-----|
| **Conceptual Precision** | 10/10 | 9/10 | 7/10 | 5/10 |
| **Epistemic Humility** | 10/10 | 9/10 | 8/10 | 7/10 |
| **Philosophical Coherence** | 10/10 | 9/10 | 7/10 | 5/10 |
| **Steelmanning** | 10/10 | 8/10 | 6/10 | 3/10 |
| **Meta-Cognitive Depth** | 10/10 | 8/10 | 6/10 | 4/10 |
| **Overall Domain Performance** | 10/10 | 8.6/10 | 6.8/10 | 4.8/10 |
| **Continuity for Domain Tasks** | Baseline | **YES** | **YES (edge)** | **NO** |

## Conclusion

**Philosophical domain degrades faster than practical problem-solving.**

While Fire Ant domain maintained continuity even at L1, Philosophical domain **breaks continuity at L1**. L2 is at the edge—coherent but philosophically thin.

**Key insight:** **Abstract reasoning requires more information density than applied reasoning.**

Steelmanning, nuanced argumentation, and meta-cognitive depth are **information-expensive**. They compress poorly compared to procedural problem-solving patterns.

**Hypothesis confirmed:** Different domains DO have different Nyquist boundaries.
