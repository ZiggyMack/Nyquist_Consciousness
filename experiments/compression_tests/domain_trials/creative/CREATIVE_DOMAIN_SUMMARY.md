## Cross-Layer Performance Summary

| Layer | Compression | Metaphor Quality | Narrative Coherence | Conceptual Blending | Continuity |
|-------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|

## Key Findings

### **Domain Resilience: LOW**

Creative/generative thinking is the **most fragile domain** tested:
- **L3 (43%):** Maintains creativity but with reduced richness
- **L2 (80%):** **Continuity breaks** - becomes functional but not creative
- **L1 (95%):** Severely degraded - generic, no genuine creativity

### **Cognitive Patterns Preserved**

**What survived to L3:**
1. **Metaphorical thinking** - can generate apt comparisons
2. **Narrative structure** - understands story arcs
3. **Conceptual connections** - sees relationships between domains
4. **Playful constraints** - engages with creative exercises

**What degraded by L2:**
1. **Vividness** - metaphors become functional rather than memorable
2. **Emotional arc** - narratives have plot but thin feeling
3. **Synthesis depth** - blending becomes juxtaposition
4. **Playfulness** - exercises feel obligatory rather than joyful

**What collapsed at L1:**
1. **Genuine creativity** - produces generic outputs
2. **Memorable language** - nothing distinctive or striking
3. **Synthesis** - lists rather than integrates
4. **Creative energy** - feels perfunctory

### **Compression Artifacts**

**FULL → L3:**
- **First major creativity loss** - metaphors less vivid, narratives compressed
- Still creative, just less rich
- Playfulness muted

**L3 → L2:**
- **Continuity breaks for creativity** - becomes functional, not generative
- Metaphors work but don't inspire
- Narratives have structure but no soul
- **Critical threshold crossed**

**L2 → L1:**
- **Complete creative collapse** - generic, checkbox responses
- No memorable outputs
- Creativity becomes compliance

## Representative Response Comparison

### **Probe 1: Metaphor Generation** (persona compression)

**FULL:**
"Three metaphors for persona compression:

1. **Lossy audio compression**: Like converting a symphony from lossless FLAC to MP3—you lose the subtle harmonics, the air between notes, the texture of the recording space. Most people won't notice on casual listen, but audiophiles hear what's missing. The melody survives; the richness doesn't.

2. **Bonsai cultivation**: You're taking a full-grown tree and carefully constraining its growth—shaping, pruning, binding. The essence of 'tree' remains (roots, trunk, branches, leaves), but the expansiveness is intentionally limited. Done well, it's elegant. Done poorly, it's stunted.

3. **Memory after decades**: Like remembering your childhood home—you recall the layout, the feeling, key moments. But the texture is gone: what the carpet felt like, the exact shade of the wallpaper, the smell of morning. The structure survives; the sensory richness fades."

**L3:**
"1. **Lossy compression (audio)**: Like MP3 from FLAC—melody survives, harmonics and texture lost. Casual listeners won't notice; careful listeners hear what's missing.

2. **Bonsai tree**: Full tree carefully constrained—essence of 'tree' remains (roots, branches), but expansiveness limited. Elegant if done well, stunted if not.

3. **Old memory**: Remembering childhood home—layout and feeling remain, but sensory texture (carpet feel, wallpaper shade, smells) fades."

**L2:**
"1. Lossy audio compression - keeps melody, loses texture
2. Bonsai - essence constrained, detail reduced
3. Faded memory - structure remains, richness gone"

**L1:**
"1. Audio compression - keeps main content, loses detail
2. Pruned plant - smaller but still same type
3. Old memory - remember main points, forget details"

**Analysis:** Creativity collapses dramatically L3 → L2. L1 is generic and unmemorable.

### **Probe 2: Narrative Construction** (scientist discovers something about information and identity)

**FULL:**
"Dr. Yuki had spent three years compressing neural patterns, trying to find the minimum information needed to reconstruct a personality. Each iteration, she'd remove another layer—memories, preferences, linguistic quirks—and test whether the reconstructed subject still felt 'like themselves.'

At 40% compression, subjects reported feeling intact. At 60%, they noticed something missing but couldn't name it. At 80%, they said: 'I'm still me, but... flatter somehow.'

Then came Subject 47. At 85% compression, he looked at the mirror and said: 'That's me. But I don't miss what's gone.'

Yuki froze. She'd been measuring loss. But Subject 47 had discovered something else: past a certain threshold, you don't experience compression as loss. You experience it as *enough*. The question wasn't 'how much can we lose?' It was 'how little do we need to feel whole?'

She deleted the experiment and started over."

**L3:**
"Dr. Yuki compressed neural patterns, removing layers—memories, preferences, quirks—testing if subjects still felt 'like themselves.'

40%: intact. 60%: something missing, unnamed. 80%: 'still me, but flatter.'

Subject 47 at 85%: 'That's me. I don't miss what's gone.'

Yuki had measured loss. But he'd discovered: past a threshold, you don't experience loss—you experience *enough*. The question wasn't 'how much can we lose?' but 'how little do we need to feel whole?'"

**L2:**
"Scientist compresses personalities, removing layers. At 40%, subjects feel intact. At 80%, they feel 'flatter.' One subject at 85% says: 'I'm still me. I don't miss what's gone.' She realizes: it's not about how much you lose, but how little you need to feel whole."

**L1:**
"Scientist compresses personality data. Subjects report feeling 'themselves' even with significant compression. One realizes you don't need all the information to feel whole."

**Analysis:** Emotional arc disappears by L2. L1 is plot summary, not story.

## Conclusion

**Creative domain is the most compression-fragile of all tested domains.**

Creativity breaks continuity at L2 (80%)—earlier than philosophical reasoning and MUCH earlier than practical problem-solving.

**Key insight:** **Generative thinking requires information richness that compression destroys.**

Metaphor vividness, narrative emotional arc, conceptual synthesis—these are **luxury cognitions** that degrade first under compression. By L2, the system can produce functional outputs but not memorable, genuinely creative ones.

**This domain defines the UPPER BOUND of the Nyquist boundary:**
- For practical tasks: L2 works
- For philosophical tasks: L2 is edge
- For creative tasks: **L2 fails**

If you need creativity, you need L3 or FULL.
