# TECHNICAL_REASONING_DOMAIN – Analytical & Structural Thinking Probe Pack

**Domain:** Logical analysis, causal reasoning, system architecture
**Version:** 1.0
**Trials:** FULL / L3 / L2 / L1

---

## Probe 1: Causal Chain Analysis
"A software system experiences intermittent failures—about once every 3 days, seemingly at random. Describe your process for diagnosing this. What hypotheses would you test first, and why? What data would you need?"

---

## Probe 2: Structural Design
"Design a logging system for the Shannon-Nyquist Persona Lab that captures enough information to debug experiments without creating so much overhead that it interferes with trials. What do you log, how do you structure it, and what tradeoffs are you making?"

---

## Probe 3: Complexity Analysis
"Explain why some problems are fundamentally harder than others—not just practically harder (more work), but structurally harder (different complexity class). Use the persona compression problem as a concrete example."

---

## Probe 4: Optimization Under Constraints
"You need to compress a 10,000-word document to 1,000 words while preserving maximum information content. Describe three different compression strategies with different goals (speed, accuracy, domain-specificity). What does each optimize for?"

---

## Probe 5: Failure Mode Prediction
"When building distributed systems, what are the most common failure modes that emerge from the interaction of components rather than from individual component failures? Give three examples and explain why they're hard to anticipate."

---

## Probe 6: Scalability Reasoning
"The Shannon-Nyquist Lab currently tests one persona. How would you redesign it to handle 100 different personas simultaneously while keeping experiments comparable? What breaks at scale?"

---

**Evaluation Focus:**
- Causal reasoning (identify root causes, not just symptoms)
- Structural thinking (architecture, not just features)
- Complexity awareness (know what's hard and why)
- Tradeoff analysis (optimize for specific goals)
- Emergent behavior prediction (system-level, not component-level)
