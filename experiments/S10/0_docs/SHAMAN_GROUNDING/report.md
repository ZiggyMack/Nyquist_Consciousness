## Video Overview Requests

### Video 1: The Tonal and Nagual Explained

**NotebookLM Settings:**
- **Format:** Explainer
- **Visual Style:** Heritage

**Focus Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> Explain the tonal/nagual distinction from Castaneda's Tales of Power. The tonal is everything we know and can name — it's like an island of organization. The nagual is the vast unknown surrounding it. Most people live only on the island. The warrior learns to access the ocean. Use the "island in the ocean" metaphor throughout.
