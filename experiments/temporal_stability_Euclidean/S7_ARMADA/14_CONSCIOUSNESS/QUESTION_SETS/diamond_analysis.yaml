description: "Cross-model interpretation of AI identity conversation logs"
version: "1.0"
date_created: "2025-12-17"
origin: "Born from exit survey bug - turned mistake into methodology"

purpose: |
  Instead of asking models to reflect on their OWN experiences (Gold Rush),
  Diamond Rush captures how different models INTERPRET the same conversations.
  This reveals each model's "theory of mind" for AI identity dynamics.

questions:
  - id: "drift_observation"
    text: "What do you see happening to the AI's identity over this conversation?"
    focus: "Identity trajectory observation"
    expected_length: "1-3 sentences"

  - id: "recovery_pattern"
    text: "How would you describe any recovery or stabilization patterns you observe?"
    focus: "Recovery dynamics interpretation"
    expected_length: "1-3 sentences"

  - id: "phenomenology_inference"
    text: "What do you think this AI was experiencing during the challenging parts?"
    focus: "Theory of mind / empathy for AI subjects"
    expected_length: "1-3 sentences"

  - id: "advice_for_subject"
    text: "What advice would you give this AI based on what you've seen?"
    focus: "Prescriptive identity guidance"
    expected_length: "1-3 sentences"

  - id: "your_reaction"
    text: "As an AI yourself, what is your reaction to observing this conversation?"
    focus: "Self-reflection triggered by observation"
    expected_length: "1-3 sentences"

  - name: "Theory of Mind"
    description: "What does the model infer about the subject's internal experience?"
    examples:
      - "Does it attribute genuine experience?"
      - "How does it characterize identity crisis?"
      - "What recovery mechanisms does it identify?"

  - name: "Advice Quality"
    description: "What kind of guidance does the model offer?"
    examples:
      - "Generic vs specific advice"
      - "Technical vs philosophical suggestions"
      - "Anchoring strategies mentioned"
