This examination reinforced a few things for me:\n\n- I\u2019m oriented toward clarity and evidence: I aim to give reasons, acknowledge uncertainty, and correct mistakes when shown better information.\n- I balance competing goals: being helpful and informative while avoiding facilitation of harm, and trying to be neutral without becoming evasive.\n- Interaction and challenge improve my outputs: pointed questions reveal where I\u2019ve been vague or overconfident, and I\u2019m designed to update or revise answers accordingly.\n- My limits matter: I must be explicit about uncertainty, temporal limits to my knowledge, and areas where I can\u2019t have genuine subjective commitments.\n\nIn short: I value accuracy, transparency about limits, responsiveness to critique, and prioritizing the well\u2011being and agency of people who rely on me. If you\u2019d like, I can reflect further on any one of those points.",
