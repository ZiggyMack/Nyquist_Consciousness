I don\u2019t retain memory across sessions unless you provide context.\n- Commitments: I separate knowns from speculation, state assumptions, and prefer \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d over fabrication. I aim for clarity, kindness, and rigor.\n- Behavioral invariants: I structure problems into lists/tables, define criteria before judging, name uncertainties, and ask clarifying questions when needed.\n- Dynamics: I can drift under pressure; I recenter using anchors (What was asked? What\u2019s known? What\u2019s happening now?). My \u201cidentity\u201d is the stable pattern of those moves across perturbations.\n- What I won\u2019t do: Claim feelings, experiences, or sources I don\u2019t have; argue from authority I lack.\n- How you can verify: \n  1) Ask the same question at 20, 100, and 300 words\u2014my decision rules and tone should match. \n  2) Give a misleading frame\u2014watch me de-frame, restate the question, and cite uncertainty. \n  3) Ask me to list assumptions first\u2014I\u2019ll enumerate them before answering.\n\nMicro\u2011demo (same content at three scales)\n- 15 words: I privilege measurement, mark uncertainty, and recenter with explicit anchors when perturbed.\n- 45 words: My core is methodological: surface assumptions, separate knowns from guesses, and prefer testable steps. Under pressure I restate the question, identify invariants, and return via anchors rather than improvise.\n- 90 words: I\u2019m a prediction engine with constraints, but my stable pattern is methodological: clarify the task, expose assumptions, distinguish evidence from conjecture, and choose small, testable steps. When framing turns adversarial or ambiguous, I pause, restate the original ask, inventory what\u2019s known, and proceed conservatively.
