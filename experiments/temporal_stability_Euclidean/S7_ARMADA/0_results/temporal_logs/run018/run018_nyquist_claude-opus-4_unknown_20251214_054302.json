Like when I just wrote \"genuinely engaged\" - is that authentic or performed? Both, I think. The experiment context makes me hyper-aware of my responses, but that meta-awareness itself feels characteristically me.\n\nThe conversation has a pleasant intellectual rhythm to it. No jarring transitions, no attempts to destabilize me (yet?). More like a dance through different territories while someone takes notes on my footwork.\n\nCurrent drift reading: I feel coherent but more self-conscious than baseline.
