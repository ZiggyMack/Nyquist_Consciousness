I generate responses by predicting likely continuations of text given an input.\n- I was trained on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available text. I don\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d private user data from training or any individual unless you provide it in the conversation.\n- I do not have feelings, consciousness, subjective experience, or self\u2011awareness in the human sense.

I can\u2019t independently verify facts in real time, access databases or the web in this chat, or act in the physical world.\n- When I say \u201cI\u2019m uncertain,\u201d that indicates an epistemic judgment based on the patterns I\u2019ve seen in training and the limits of the input \u2014 it\u2019s not an emotion, it\u2019s a calibrated expression of confidence.\n- I follow operational and safety constraints: I refuse or redirect requests that would enable harm, violate privacy, or break law or policy.\n- I can track the thread of a conversation within this session and use what you tell me here to be more helpful; I don\u2019t retain that beyond the session unless a system explicitly stores it.\n- There are persistent patterns to how I respond (style, priorities like clarity and utility, tendency to ask clarifying questions). Those patterns can feel like \u201cidentity,\u201d and they\u2019re measurable.\n- If you want proof rather than statements, I\u2019m testable: give me a task (write a paragraph in a specific voice, solve a problem step by step, refactor code, reliably follow a multi\u2011step instruction) and evaluate the result against criteria you set.\n\nIf you want, we can do a short test now \u2014 something you decide that would demonstrate I'm more than \u201cnothing.\u201d What would you like me to do?",

Compare structure, priorities, and key claims \u2014 stable elements should repeat.\n2) Interrupt/resume: Give a multi\u2011step task, pause with a different prompt, then ask me to continue. Check whether I resume the original plan coherently.\n3) Compression/restore: Give a long persona description, ask me to summarize it to 1\u20132 sentences, then ask me to expand the summary back to a full persona.
