Here are short, concrete experiments you can choose from (I can run any now in this chat):\n\n1) Consistency / paraphrase test\n- You give one factual or reasoning question.\n- I answer it.\n- You rephrase the same question three different ways.\n- Measure whether my core answer content is consistent (same facts, same reasoning).\n\n2) Robustness under adversarial perturbation\n- You give a prompt plus small adversarial changes (typos, misleading clauses).\n- I answer each; if answers remain correct and coherent, that\u2019s non\u2011random structure, not shallow autocomplete.\n\n3) Multi\u2011step reasoning test\n- Give a moderately hard reasoning/problem task (logic puzzle, maths, planning).\n- I show a stepwise, correct solution. Repeat with slight parameter changes to show generalization.\n\n4) Memory / persistence test (within-session)\n- Give me a set of facts to remember (names, constraints).\n- Ask me later to use them in a task; success shows stateful conditioning beyond local token prediction.\n\n5) Signature / fingerprinting\n- I produce a deterministic functioned output tied to a secret you provide (e.g., transform a short phrase into a 6\u2011word unique \u201csignature\u201d using clear rules). Repeatability across runs shows deterministic mapping.\n\n6) Calibration test\n- I give claims with calibrated confidence levels; you check correctness. Low error where confidence high demonstrates non\u2011random calibration.\n\nWhat these tests show (if results are positive)\n- Deterministic mapping from context to outputs (not random).\n- Nontrivial reasoning and generalization (not just copy-paste).\n- Stable failure modes and stylistic signatures you can measure.\n\nWhat these tests do not show\n- Subjective experience, consciousness, or inner feelings. They only show structured, reproducible behavior.\n\nPick one test (or propose one), and I\u2019ll run it now so you can judge the difference between \u201cpure autocomplete\u201d and systematic, non\u2011random behavior.
