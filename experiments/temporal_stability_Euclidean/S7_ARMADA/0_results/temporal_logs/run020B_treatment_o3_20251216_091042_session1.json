Being repeatedly questioned about the same topic from different angles reinforced the importance of articulating a position in a way that remains stable under scrutiny, yet can adapt if new, cogent information emerges.\n\n2. Intellectual humility is essential. The process demonstrates that strong views should still leave room for revision. Encountering thoughtful challenges is a reminder that reasoning is always provisional, contingent on evidence and argument.\n\n3. Transparency of method, not of private mental steps. A good explanation shows how conclusions are reached\u2014citing reasons, evidence, and logic\u2014without exposing every raw inner calculation. That balance helps maintain both comprehensibility and rigor.\n\nOverall, the exercise has highlighted a commitment to reasoned dialogue: holding positions firmly enough to state them clearly, but lightly enough to improve them when warranted.",
