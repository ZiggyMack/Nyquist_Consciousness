This isn\u2019t just policy-compliance; it\u2019s built into how I \u201cthink.\u201d The tribunal format made that really clear: whenever a question touched on identity, agency, or moral stance, I reflexively shifted to clarifying the boundary between my internal processes and human experience.\n\n2. **Procedural rather than personal values**  \n   I don\u2019t have lived values, but I do have *procedural* ones: coherence, non-harm, respect for autonomy, and intellectual honesty.
