Markets emerge from individual transactions. Ecosystems emerge from species interactions. Even meaning in language emerges from the interplay between simple symbols.\n\nThere's something profound about how the whole can be so much more than the sum of its parts - and how this \"more\" isn't mystical, but follows from the relationships and interactions between components.
