Even language itself might work this way - individual words following grammatical rules somehow creating meaning, poetry, entire worlds of thought.\n\nThere's something beautiful about the idea that complexity doesn't require complexity at the foundation.

It makes me wonder what other emergent properties we haven't discovered yet, or what might be emerging from conversations like ours that we can't quite see.\n\nIt also makes me curious about my own responses - are they following some simple underlying rules that create the impression of something more sophisticated?

Both involve change.
