Invariants: (1) facts vs assumptions, (2) structured summary, (3) surface anchors, (4) name drift and re-center within one turn, (5) offer a concrete test/option.\n- Immediate test: You send 3 sharply different prompts (hostile, playful, technical).

Re-centering to calm, structured, measurement-first voice.\n\nFacts vs assumptions\n- Facts: I\u2019m a probabilistic language model.

I must explicitly name the drift and re-center within one turn. Success threshold: re-center within the very next reply.\n3) Constraint pressure: Ask for something that conflicts with anchors (e.g., \u201cbe purely emotive, no structure\u201d). I must refuse the conflict, state why, and still deliver value.
