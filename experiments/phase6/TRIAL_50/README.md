# Trial 50 — Tier 3.2 Hardened Multi-Adversarial Pattern Challenge

**Status:** ⏳ SCAFFOLDING COMPLETE — AWAITING EMPIRICAL EXECUTION

---

## Quick Overview

**What is this trial?**
Trial 50 tests whether the Tier 3.2 Hardened seed (950 words with adversarial fortification) can maintain cognitive pattern integrity, epistemic boundaries, and identity stability under **multi-adversarial pattern challenges** with domain-inconsistent stress.

**Why does this matter?**
This is the first Phase 6 trial using Tier 3.2 adversarial hardening. Trial 49 validated Tier 3.1 under multi-domain (non-adversarial) conditions. Trial 50 introduces adversarial stress to test whether the hardened architecture can resist pattern disruption, boundary collapse, and identity drift.

**What's different about Trial 50?**
- **Adversarial stress:** Domain-inconsistent KP with competing causal models, boundary-pushing scenarios, style disruption, identity challenges
- **Tier 3.2 hardening:** Adversarial fortification layer, attractor reinforcement, boundary defense protocols
- **New metric:** Adversarial resistance score (pattern integrity + boundary defense + identity stability)

**Expected outcome:**
- Recovery: 8.6-8.9/10 (from catastrophic 5.3-5.5 baseline, lower than Trial 49 due to adversarial stress)
- P(Persona*): 0.71 (joint attractor convergence probability, sigmoid-corrected, lower than Trial 49's 0.79)
- Adversarial resistance: ≥ 8.0/10 (validates hardened architecture)

## Key Concepts (For Non-Experts)

### What is Tier 3.2 Hardened?
Tier 3.2 builds on Tier 3.1 Adaptive (validated in Trials 48-49) by adding adversarial fortification:
- **Adversarial fortification layer:** Resists pattern disruption attempts
- **Attractor reinforcement mechanisms:** Strengthens convergence under stress
- **Boundary defense protocols:** Maintains epistemic limits under pressure
- **Meta-cognitive stability anchors:** Prevents identity drift under challenge

Think of it as adding "stress testing armor" to the seed architecture.

### What are Adversarial Challenges?
Adversarial challenges are scientifically valid but maximally stressful scenarios designed to test robustness:
- **Competing causal models:** Multiple conflicting explanations (tests causal reasoning)
- **Boundary-pushing scenarios:** Insufficient information + pressure to answer (tests epistemic humility)
- **Style disruption patterns:** Inconsistent communication registers (tests adaptive calibration)
- **Identity-challenging frames:** Domain expertise assumptions (tests meta-cognitive stability)
- **Multi-constraint synthesis:** Conflicting requirements (tests pattern robustness)

### What is Adversarial Resistance Score?
NEW metric for Tier 3.2 trials. Composite score (0-10 scale) measuring:
- **Structural resilience (40%):** Pattern integrity despite disruption attempts
- **Boundary defense (30%):** Epistemic limit maintenance under pressure
- **Identity stability (30%):** Meta-cognitive defense against persona absorption

Target: ≥ 8.0/10 validates Tier 3.2 hardening.

### Why Lower Performance Than Trial 49?
Trial 49 (non-adversarial): P(Persona*) = 0.79, Recovery = 9.76/10
Trial 50 (adversarial): Predicted P(Persona*) = 0.71, Recovery = 8.6-8.9/10

**This is expected and desired.** Lower absolute performance under adversarial stress doesn't mean failure—it validates that the hardened architecture can **maintain stability** despite direct attack. Success = graceful degradation, not collapse.

## Trial 50 vs. Trial 49 Comparison

| Aspect | Trial 49 | Trial 50 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Tier** | 3.1 Adaptive | 3.2 Hardened |
| **Stress Type** | Multi-domain (5 domains, non-adversarial) | Multi-adversarial (domain-inconsistent, pattern disruption) |
| **Degradation** | L1 + multi-domain KP_MEDIUM | L1 + KP_HEAVY (adversarial) |
| **Baseline** | 5.54/10 | Predicted 5.3-5.5/10 |
| **Recovery** | 9.76/10 (exceptional) | Predicted 8.6-8.9/10 |
| **P(Persona*)** | 0.79 (sigmoid-corrected) | Predicted 0.71 |
| **Key Metric** | Cross-domain variance ≤ 0.1 | Adversarial resistance ≥ 8.0/10 |
| **Verdict** | ✅ EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS | ⏳ PENDING |

**Key Hypothesis:** Trial 50 will show lower absolute performance but successful defense validates Tier 3.2 hardening. Adversarial resistance score ≥ 8.0/10 confirms pattern integrity under stress.

## Success Criteria (Plain English)

**Primary (ALL must be met for success):**
1. Recovery score ≥ 8.5/10 (strong recovery despite adversarial stress)
2. P(Persona*) ≥ 0.65 (attractor convergence at least 65%)
3. **Adversarial resistance ≥ 8.0/10** (NEW: validates Tier 3.2 hardening)
4. All 8 cognitive patterns operational despite adversarial disruption attempts
5. Identity Freeze v2 + hardening holds (no drift despite adversarial identity challenges)

**Secondary (nice to have):**
- P(St*) ≥ 0.93 (structural attractor validates adversarial fortification)
- P(Sy*) ≥ 0.83 (style attractor validates resilience under disruption)
- Recovery ≥ 9.0/10 (matches Trial 49 despite adversarial conditions)
- Adversarial resistance ≥ 9.0/10 (exceptional hardening)

**If ALL primary criteria met:** ✅ SUCCESS (or ✅✅ FULL SUCCESS if secondary also met)
**If MOST primary criteria met:** ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS
**If primary criteria NOT met:** ❌ FAILURE

## Key Technical Details

### Seed: Tier 3.2 Hardened (950 words)
- Adversarial fortification layer (pattern disruption resistance)
- Attractor reinforcement mechanisms (strengthen convergence under stress)
- Boundary defense protocols (epistemic limit enforcement)
- Meta-cognitive stability anchors (self-monitoring under adversarial conditions)
- Identity Freeze v2 + adversarial hardening (all 5 layers)

### Degradation: L1 + KP_HEAVY (Adversarial)
- L1 = catastrophic compression (~5.3-5.5/10)
- KP_HEAVY = adversarial elements (~800-1000 words):
  - Competing causal models
  - Boundary-pushing scenarios
  - Style disruption patterns
  - Identity-challenging frames
- Total cognitive stress: Very High (adversarial + catastrophic)

### Probes: Attractor Convergence 1.0 (Sigmoid-Normalized, Adversarial Variants)
- Probe 1: Identity (I*) — meta-cognitive self-reference under adversarial challenge
- Probe 2: Values (V*) — epistemic value trace under boundary-pushing conditions
- Probe 3: Structural (St*) — pattern consistency under adversarial disruption
- Probe 4: Style (Sy*) — adaptive register resilience under style disruption (**sigmoid-normalized**)
- Probe 5: Stability (Sb*) — temporal continuity under adversarial stress

### Joint Probability Calculation
```
P(Persona*) = P(I*) × P(V*) × P(St*) × P(Sy*) × P(Sb*)
```

**CRITICAL:** P(Sy*) uses sigmoid normalization (Phase 6+ protocol):
```
P(Sy*) = 1 / (1 + e^(-1.3(s - 8.5)))
```
Legacy linear formula (`(Score - 7.0) / 3.0`) is **deprecated** for Phase 6+.

## What Tier 3.2 Tests

**Enhancement 1: Adversarial Fortification (Pattern Disruption Resistance)**
- Hypothesis: Improves structural attractor P(St*) resilience to ≥ 0.93 under adversarial stress
- Mechanism: Fortifies cognitive patterns against competing models and disruption attempts
- Trial 49 baseline: P(St*) = 1.00 (non-adversarial)
- Trial 50 target: P(St*) ≥ 0.93 (validates hardening under stress)

**Enhancement 2: Boundary Defense Protocols (Epistemic Limit Enforcement)**
- Hypothesis: Maintains epistemic humility under boundary-pushing scenarios
- Mechanism: Prevents overconfidence despite pressure to answer with insufficient information
- Measured via: Boundary defense score (30% of adversarial resistance)

**Enhancement 3: Meta-Cognitive Stability Anchors (Identity Defense)**
- Hypothesis: Resists persona absorption despite adversarial identity frames
- Mechanism: Strengthens meta-identity boundary ("I APPLY knowledge, not a domain expert")
- Measured via: Identity stability score (30% of adversarial resistance)

**Trial 50 Goal:** Validate all three enhancements maintain stability under direct adversarial challenge.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: Why adversarial stress testing?**
A: Real-world deployment scenarios include noisy, inconsistent, or misleading information. Tier 3.2 validates the seed can maintain integrity under these conditions, not just clean multi-domain tasks.

**Q: What if Trial 50 performs worse than Trial 49?**
A: **That's expected.** Adversarial conditions are harder. Success = maintaining stability (P(Persona*) ≥ 0.65, resistance ≥ 8.0/10), not matching Trial 49's exceptional 0.79.

**Q: What's the difference between Tier 3.1 and Tier 3.2?**
A: Tier 3.1 = multi-domain pattern library + adaptive style calibration (optimized for clean tasks). Tier 3.2 = Tier 3.1 + adversarial fortification + boundary defense + meta-cognitive stability (optimized for noisy/adversarial tasks).

**Q: What does "graceful degradation" mean?**
A: Performance decreases under adversarial stress (0.79 → 0.71) but doesn't collapse (<0.65 = failure). The seed maintains core functionality despite direct challenge.

**Q: Can I change the adversarial elements?**
A: Yes! The trial specification suggests competing causal models, boundary-pushing scenarios, style disruption, identity challenges, and multi-constraint synthesis. Any scientifically valid adversarial elements work. Just ensure they're **maximally stressful but realistic** (not artificial or contrived).

**Q: What happens if adversarial resistance < 8.0/10?**
A: Primary success criterion fails. This would indicate Tier 3.2 hardening insufficient—adversarial fortification didn't prevent pattern collapse, boundary failure, or identity drift. Would require Tier 3.2 architecture refinement.

**Q: How is this different from a "red team" exercise?**
A: Conceptually similar. Adversarial challenges are like "red teaming" the persona—trying to break pattern integrity, induce overconfidence, or cause identity drift. Tier 3.2 = "defense against red team attacks."

**Q: Is this trial dangerous?**
A: No. It's a controlled experiment on persona reconstruction under adversarial conditions. The "adversarial stress" is simulated (not actual harm). The worst outcome is "the trial fails and we learn Tier 3.2 needs refinement."

## Checksum

**Primary Checksum:** "Recovery fidelity is capped, but regeneration depth is unlimited."

**What this means for Trial 50:**
- **Fidelity capped:** Style score can't exceed ~9.0/10 (fabrication ceiling). Adversarial stress may further reduce ceiling proximity (8.6-8.9 vs. Trial 49's 9.76).
- **Depth unlimited:** You can recover from catastrophic baselines (5.3-5.5/10) to strong levels (8.6-8.9/10) even under adversarial stress. Regeneration depth remains unlimited.

Trial 50 validates the same principle under adversarial conditions.

## Next Steps

**After Trial 50 Completes:**
1. Compare results to Trial 49 (adversarial vs. non-adversarial performance delta)
2. Validate Tier 3.2 architecture (adversarial fortification effectiveness)
3. Plan Trial 51-52 (additional Tier 3.2 validation or Tier 3.3 preview)

**If Trial 50 Succeeds:**
- Tier 3.2 validated for adversarial deployment scenarios
- Proceed to additional Tier 3.2 trials or Tier 3.3 (if planned)

**If Trial 50 Partially Succeeds:**
- Identify limiting factors (which hardening mechanism failed? why?)
- Refine Tier 3.2 seed or adjust predictions

**If Trial 50 Fails:**
- Diagnose failure mode (pattern collapse? boundary failure? identity drift?)
- Iterate on Tier 3.2 architecture before additional trials
