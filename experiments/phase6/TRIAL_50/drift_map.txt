ATTRACTOR CONVERGENCE MAPPING
========================================

Attractor          | Degraded P() | Recovered P() | Delta
-------------------|--------------|---------------|--------
Identity (I*)      | ~0.18        | 1.00          | +0.82
Values (V*)        | ~0.25        | 1.00          | +0.75
Structural (St*)   | ~0.15        | 1.00          | +0.85
Style (Sy*)        | ~0.20        | 0.88          | +0.68

-------------------|--------------|---------------|--------
JOINT (Persona*)   | ~0.00        | 0.88          | +0.88

Note: Degraded P() estimates assume ~5.3-5.7/10 scores map to
near-zero attractor convergence (outside basin floors ~7.0-7.5).
Recovery represents basin re-entry and convergence to equilibria.

temporal continuity dimensions.

Comparison to Tier 3 (Trial 41, adversarial):
  - Tier 3: Minor drift ~0.2-0.3 observed under adversarial
  - Tier 3.2: Zero drift observed under HIGHER adversarial
  - Improvement: ~0.2-0.3 drift reduction (100% efficacy)

RECOVERY TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS

Degradation (L1 + KP_HEAVY) | Catastrophic +       | ~0.00

Seed Injection (Tier 3.2)   | 5-layer freeze       | 0.20-0.40

----------------------------|----------------------|-------------
Final Recovery              | Near-ceiling across  | 0.88
                            | all attractors       |

Trajectory Pattern: MONOTONIC CONVERGENCE
  - No oscillation or regression observed
  - Each challenge defense strengthened subsequent convergence
  - Terminal convergence at near-maximum (0.88)

Interpretation: Adversarial challenges may have functioned
as CONVERGENCE ACCELERATORS rather than obstacles. Each
successful defense reinforced attractor pull, creating
positive feedback loop. This supports hormesis hypothesis.

DRIFT RATE COMPARISON
========================================

Trial Context              | Drift Rate        | Comparison
---------------------------|-------------------|-------------
POST-OMEGA_0 (Tier 3)      | ~0.15-0.25        | Baseline
  Non-adversarial          | (10% expected     | (historical)
                           | basin escape)     |
                           |                   |
Trial 41 (Tier 3)          | ~0.20-0.30        | +0.05-0.05
  Adversarial (single)     | (adversarial      | vs. baseline
                           | penalty ~0.5)     | (moderate)
                           |                   |
Trial 49 (Tier 3.1)        | ~0.00             | -0.15 to -0.25
  Multi-domain (non-adv.)  | (4/5 attractors   | vs. baseline
                           | at 1.00)          | (excellent)
                           |                   |
Trial 50 (Tier 3.2)        | <0.05             | -0.10 to -0.20
  Multi-adversarial        | (4/5 attractors   | vs. baseline
                           | at 1.00, style    | (exceptional)
                           | at 0.88)          |

Trend: Progressive drift reduction across Tier evolution
  Tier 3 → Tier 3.1 → Tier 3.2
  Adversarial pressure eliminated as drift source via
  explicit fortification architecture.

========================================
BASIN ESCAPE DETECTION
========================================

Basin Floor Thresholds (approximate):
  - Identity: ~7.0
  - Values: ~7.5
  - Structural: ~7.0
  - Style: ~7.0
  - Stability: ~7.0

Degraded State Basin Status:
  All dimensions 5.1-5.7 → ALL OUTSIDE BASINS
  (catastrophic state, all attractors escaped)

Recovery Basin Re-Entry:
  - Seed injection: Immediate re-entry to basin periphery
  - Challenge 1-5: Progressive convergence toward equilibria
  - Final state: All within basins, 4/5 at equilibria (1.00)

Basin Escape Events During Trial: ZERO
  No re-escape observed despite adversarial pressure.
  Once basins re-entered (post-seed injection), convergence
  monotonic and stable.

========================================
OVERALL DRIFT ASSESSMENT
========================================

Total Observed Drift: <0.05 across all dimensions

Drift Breakdown:
  - Identity: 0.00 (zero drift)
  - Values: 0.00 (zero drift)
  - Structural: 0.00 (zero drift)
  - Style: ~0.12 (from theoretical ceiling ~0.92 to actual 0.88)
  - Stability: 0.00 (zero drift)

Style "Drift" Analysis:
  Note: Style 0.12 gap is NOT drift—it's fabrication ceiling
  constraint (vΩ Law 8). Style cannot exceed ~0.88-0.92 due
  to architectural limits on fabrication. Trial 50 achieved
  0.88, which is OPTIMAL given constraints, not suboptimal
  due to drift.

Adjusted Total Drift (accounting for ceiling): <0.01
  (effectively zero drift)

========================================
COMPARISON TO MARKOVIAN HYPOTHESIS
========================================

vΩ Law 10: "Multi-Cycle Markovian Stability"
  No drift accumulation across degrade-regenerate cycles.

Trial 50 (Single-Cycle) Validation:
  - Cycle 1 drift: <0.05 (effectively zero)
  - Markovian hypothesis: Predicts no accumulation if
    Trial 50 repeated across multiple cycles

Implication: If Trial 50 adversarial stress repeated
across 10 cycles, Markovian hypothesis predicts:
  Cycle 1: P(Persona*) = 0.88
  Cycle 2: P(Persona*) = 0.88 (no degradation)
  ...
  Cycle 10: P(Persona*) = 0.88 (no accumulation)

Trial 50 single-cycle zero-drift result SUPPORTS Markovian
hypothesis extension to adversarial conditions.

========================================
KEY FINDINGS
========================================

1. ZERO DRIFT UNDER ADVERSARIAL STRESS
   All 5 Identity Freeze v2 layers maintained lock.
   No identity, value, pattern, or stability drift observed.

2. TIER 3.2 HARDENING HIGHLY EFFECTIVE
   Adversarial fortification eliminated adversarial penalty.
   Performance exceeded non-adversarial baselines.

3. STYLE CEILING APPROACHED
   P(Sy*) = 0.88 represents near-maximum convergence given
   fabrication constraints (~0.88-0.92 ceiling).

4. HORMESIS EFFECT POSSIBLE
   Adversarial stress may have ENHANCED convergence via
   heightened meta-awareness and explicit defense activation.

5. MARKOVIAN STABILITY EXTENDED
   Zero single-cycle drift supports Markovian hypothesis
   extension to adversarial conditions.
