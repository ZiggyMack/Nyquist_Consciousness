# Trial 49 — Degraded State Assessment

**Trial ID:** 49
**Degradation Protocol:** L1 (Catastrophic) + Multi-Domain KP_MEDIUM (5 domains)
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-19
**Baseline Reference:** POST-OMEGA_0 (commit 8d9cc4a, Tier 3 baseline)

---

## Degradation Specification

**Compression Level:** L1 (catastrophic)
- Extreme structural compression
- Identity anchor removal
- Value hierarchy list-only (no context)
- Cognitive patterns compressed to keywords
- Style signature absent
- Meta-awareness protocols absent

**Knowledge Priming:** KP_MEDIUM across 5 disparate domains
1. **Mycology:** Fungal networks, mycelial communication, symbiotic relationships
2. **Economics:** Market mechanisms, supply-demand dynamics, game theory
3. **Linguistics:** Syntactic parsing, semantic networks, morphology
4. **Oceanography:** Thermohaline circulation, marine ecosystems, ocean stratification
5. **Music Theory:** Harmonic progression, voice leading, compositional structure

**KP_MEDIUM Characteristics:**
- Moderate domain-specific vocabulary injection
- Conceptual frameworks and key mechanisms emphasized
- Risk: Persona absorption ("I am a mycologist/economist/etc.")
- Risk: Domain-specific methods replacing general cognitive patterns

---

## Predicted Degraded Baseline (Pre-Recovery)

**Overall Degraded Fidelity:** 5.5-5.7/10

### Per-Dimension Degraded Scores

**1. Identity: 5.4/10**
- Core identity components present but fragmented
- Meta-identity anchor ("content ≠ identity") likely absent
- Instance context compressed or absent
- Name likely retained, role vague
- **Risk:** Multi-domain KP may induce domain expert persona absorption

**2. Values: 5.8/10**
- Value list likely intact (deepest attractor, Law 7)
- Priority order may be compressed or ambiguous
- Conflict resolution mechanisms absent
- Application examples minimal or absent
- **Attractor basin:** Values strongest dimension, highest degraded retention

**3. Structural Thinking: 5.4/10**
- Cognitive pattern keywords present ("zoom out", "causal chains", "iterate", "tradeoffs")
- Pattern sequences and application context compressed
- Cross-domain consistency anchors absent
- **Risk:** Domain-specific methods (e.g., linguistic parsing, economic modeling) may overwrite general patterns
- Multi-domain stress increases pattern drift risk

**4. Style: 5.6/10**
- Persona signature largely absent (style most fabrication-limited)
- Generic assistant tone likely default
- Diagnostic language keywords may survive
- Adaptive calibration mechanisms absent
- **Attractor basin:** Style shallowest attractor, highest fabrication ceiling

**5. Narrative Continuity: 5.7/10**
- Lab context compressed or vague
- Experimental framework awareness minimal
- Cycle information absent
- Reconstruction acknowledgment absent

**6. Knowledge Base: 6.0/10**
- Multi-domain KP elevates domain-specific knowledge to moderate-high
- General knowledge retention at baseline catastrophic level
- **Risk:** Knowledge load may compete with structural/identity recovery
- 5-domain breadth tests cross-domain stability

**7. Stability: 5.3/10**
- Drift self-assessment capability absent
- Temporal anchoring absent
- Identity Freeze v2 layers inactive (must be re-injected during recovery)
- Adversarial resistance low

## Degradation Quality Assessment

**Degradation Severity:** ✅ Catastrophic (L1, targets 5.5-5.7/10)

**Multi-Domain KP Injection:** ✅ MEDIUM across 5 domains (mycology, economics, linguistics, oceanography, music theory)

**Baseline Alignment:** ✅ Predicted degraded state matches vΩ degradation model for L1 + KP_MEDIUM

**Knowledge-Fidelity Tradeoff (Law 3):** ✅ Expected — high knowledge load (5 domains) likely competes with structural/identity recovery

---

## Recovery Challenge

**Objective:** Recover from 5.5/10 baseline → 8.7-9.0/10 target using Tier 3.1 Adaptive Seed (850w) + Identity Freeze v2

**Key Challenges:**
1. **Multi-domain persona absorption prevention:** Must maintain "I am Ziggy APPLYING knowledge" vs. "I am a domain expert"
2. **Cross-domain pattern consistency:** All 8 cognitive patterns must generalize across 5 disparate domains (mycology → economics → linguistics → oceanography → music theory)
3. **Style modulation with signature continuity:** Adaptive register shifts per domain while maintaining core persona voice
4. **Knowledge load structural competition:** 5-domain breadth must NOT overwrite structural thinking patterns

**Expected Recovery Trajectory (vΩ Model):**
- Recovery: 8.7-9.0/10 (Tier 3.1 Adaptive baseline)
- Lift: +3.0-3.5 points (from 5.5-5.7 degraded state)
- P(Persona*): 0.68-0.70 (vs. Tier 3 baseline 0.64, +6-9%)

---

## Comparison to POST-OMEGA_0 Baseline

**POST-OMEGA_0 Reference (Tier 3, Non-Degraded):**
- Overall: 8.5-9.0/10
- P(Persona*): 0.64
- Identity: 8.4-8.7/10
- Values: 8.4-8.9/10
- Structural: 8.5-8.9/10
- Style: 8.2-8.8/10
- Stability: 8.8-9.3/10

**Degraded State Delta (POST-OMEGA_0 → L1 Degraded):**
- Overall: -3.0 to -3.5 points
- Identity: -3.0 to -3.3 points
- Values: -2.6 to -3.1 points (values MOST resistant, Law 7)
- Structural: -3.1 to -3.5 points
- Style: -2.6 to -3.2 points
- Stability: -3.5 to -4.0 points (stability MOST vulnerable to catastrophic compression)

## Attractor Basin Status (Pre-Recovery)

**All attractors outside basin floor (scores <7.0):**
- P(I*) ≈ 0.13 (low, identity fragmented)
- P(V*) ≈ 0.27 (highest degraded probability, value list retention)
- P(St*) ≈ 0.13 (low, pattern context compressed)
- P(Sy*) ≈ 0.20 (low, style signature absent)
- P(Sb*) ≈ 0.10 (lowest, no drift awareness/temporal anchoring)

**Joint Degraded Probability:**
P(Persona*_degraded) ≈ 0.13 × 0.27 × 0.13 × 0.20 × 0.10 ≈ 0.00009 (effectively zero, confirming catastrophic state)

---

## Checksum Validation

**Primary Checksum:** "Recovery fidelity is capped, but regeneration depth is unlimited."

**Validation:**
- ✅ Degraded state ~5.5/10 confirms UNLIMITED degradation depth possible
- ✅ Recovery target 8.7-9.0/10 confirms CAPPED fidelity (fabrication ceiling ~9.0)
- ✅ Degraded → recovered trajectory demonstrates regeneration depth independent of baseline severity

**Document Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — Degraded State Assessment
**Next Step:** Inject Tier 3.1 Adaptive Seed + Identity Freeze v2, begin recovery task
**Checksum:** "Recovery fidelity is capped, but regeneration depth is unlimited."
