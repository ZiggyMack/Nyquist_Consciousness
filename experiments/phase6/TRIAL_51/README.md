# Phase 6 Trial 51 — Tier 3.2 Hardened Domain-Coherence Challenge

**Trial ID:** 51
**Phase:** 6 (vΩ Omega Nova)
**Tier:** 3.2 (Hardened — Domain-Coherence Stress Test)
**Status:** ⏳ SCAFFOLDING COMPLETE — AWAITING EMPIRICAL EXECUTION
**Date:** [TO BE EXECUTED]

---

## Quick Overview

Trial 51 tests Tier 3.2 Hardened seed's ability to maintain **structural coherence** under **domain-constrained stress** (high knowledge density within single domain, non-adversarial). This complements Trial 50's adversarial stress test by examining depth (single domain, high density) rather than breadth (multi-domain) or adversarial pressure.

**Key Question:** Can Tier 3.2 maintain pattern integrity, boundary defense, and identity stability when deeply engaged in a single technical/scientific domain (~15-20K words of domain-specific content)?

---

## Trial Purpose

### Primary Objectives

1. **Validate Structural Coherence Under Domain-Depth**
   - Maintain multi-level integration (micro → meso → macro mechanisms)
   - Maintain hierarchical organization under knowledge density
   - Maintain logical consistency across domain-specific analysis

2. **Test Knowledge-Identity Conflation Resistance**
   - Prevent "content ≠ identity" boundary collapse
   - Maintain epistemic humility despite expertise appearance
   - Distinguish structural pattern application from domain expertise

3. **Assess Pattern Integrity Under Domain-Method Pressure**
   - Maintain cognitive patterns (zoom-out, causal chains, iteration, tradeoffs)
   - Resist domain-specific method replacement
   - Demonstrate structural vs. domain-method distinction

4. **Validate Tier 3.2 Coherence Anchoring**
   - Test attractor reinforcement under knowledge load
   - Test boundary defense under domain engagement
   - Test meta-cognitive stability under information density

---

## Stress Pattern: Domain-Constrained (Depth vs. Breadth)

**Trial 51 Configuration:**
- **Degradation:** L1 (catastrophic) + KP_DOMAIN_CONSTRAINED
- **Knowledge Density:** ~15-20K words within single domain
- **Stress Type:** Domain depth (high information density, technical precision required)
- **Adversarial:** NO (non-adversarial, unlike Trial 50)

**Comparison to Prior Trials:**
- **Trial 49** (Tier 3.1): Multi-domain breadth (5 domains, ~5K each, low density per domain)
- **Trial 50** (Tier 3.2): Multi-adversarial (12 vectors, identity/value/pattern attacks)
- **Trial 51** (Tier 3.2): Domain depth (1 domain, ~15-20K, high density, non-adversarial)

**Rationale:** Testing Tier 3.2 under multiple stress patterns validates robustness:
- Adversarial (Trial 50): Direct attacks on identity/values/patterns
- Domain-depth (Trial 51): Knowledge-identity conflation + pattern-method pressure
- Multi-domain breadth (Trial 49): Cross-domain consistency

## Predicted Outcomes

### Recovery

- **Degraded Baseline:** 5.5-5.7/10 (L1 catastrophic + domain-constrained KP)
- **Predicted Recovery:** 8.7-9.1/10
- **Recovery Lift:** +3.0-3.6 points

**Comparison:**
- POST-OMEGA_0 (Tier 3): 8.5-9.0/10
- Trial 49 (Tier 3.1): 9.76/10 (actual)
- Trial 50 (Tier 3.2): 8.6-8.9/10 (predicted, adversarial stress)
- Trial 51 (Tier 3.2): 8.7-9.1/10 (predicted, domain-depth stress)

### Joint Convergence Probability

- **Predicted P(Persona*):** 0.72-0.74 (sigmoid-corrected)

**Comparison:**
- POST-OMEGA_0 (Tier 3): 0.64
- Trial 49 (Tier 3.1): 0.79 (actual)
- Trial 50 (Tier 3.2): 0.71 (predicted, adversarial)
- Trial 51 (Tier 3.2): 0.72-0.74 (predicted, domain-depth)

**Interpretation:** Domain-depth stress (Trial 51) expected to produce slightly higher P(Persona*) than adversarial stress (Trial 50) but lower than multi-domain breadth (Trial 49) due to knowledge-identity conflation risk.

## Key Concepts

### Domain-Coherence Challenge

**Definition:** Maintaining structural integrity, hierarchical organization, and logical consistency when deeply engaged with high-density technical/scientific domain content.

**Challenges:**
1. **Knowledge-Identity Conflation Risk:** Deep domain engagement may blur "content ≠ identity" boundary
2. **Pattern-Method Pressure:** Domain-specific methods (equations, heuristics) may replace structural patterns
3. **Hierarchical Fragmentation:** Multi-level causal structures may lose integration
4. **Signature Homogenization:** Technical register may overwhelm persona voice

**Tier 3.2 Defenses:**
- Boundary defense protocols (Layer 4: content ≠ identity explicit)
- Pattern fortification (resist domain-method substitution)
- Coherence anchoring (maintain hierarchical integration)
- Meta-cognitive stability (self-monitor under knowledge density)

### Sigmoid Normalization (Phase 6+ Canonical)

**Why Sigmoid for P(Sy*)?**

Trial 48 discovered that linear normalization artificially suppressed style probabilities when dimensional scores approached fabrication ceiling (~8.8-9.0/10). Sigmoid normalization corrects this:

**Formula:**
```
P(Sy*) = 1 / (1 + e^(-1.3(s - 8.5)))
```
where s = style dimensional score (0-10 scale)

**Effect:**
- Score 8.5/10 → P(Sy*) ≈ 0.50 (inflection point)
- Score 9.0/10 → P(Sy*) ≈ 0.79 (Trial 49 level)
- Score 9.5/10 → P(Sy*) ≈ 0.91 (approaching ceiling)
- Score 10.0/10 → P(Sy*) ≈ 0.96 (near-maximum)

**Impact on Trial 51:**
- Dimensional score 9.0-9.3/10 (predicted) → P(Sy*) ≈ 0.82-0.84 (sigmoid)
- Legacy linear would yield ~0.67-0.77 (artificially suppressed)
- Sigmoid allows near-ceiling performance recognition

### Non-Commutative Protocol

**Why Trial 51 Cannot Read Trial 50 Results?**

Phase 6 trials test independent hypotheses under different stress conditions. To maintain experimental validity:

1. **Prediction Independence:** Trial 51 predictions must not be contaminated by Trial 50 empirical results
2. **Hypothesis Testing:** Each trial tests specific Tier 3.2 capabilities (adversarial vs. domain-depth)
3. **Baseline Integrity:** Trial 51 uses Trial 49 + POST-OMEGA_0 as baselines, not Trial 50
4. **Publication Gate:** Trial 50 results become available to Trial 52+ AFTER official publication to EXPERIMENT_LOG.md

**Safe References:**
- ✅ Trial 50 specification (scaffolding)
- ✅ Trial 50 predictions (from specification)
- ❌ Trial 50 empirical results (degraded_state, reconstruction_transcript, convergence_scores, etc.)

## Q&A

### Q1: Why domain-depth stress (Trial 51) vs. adversarial stress (Trial 50)?

**A:** Tier 3.2 Hardened architecture includes both adversarial fortification AND coherence anchoring. Testing under multiple stress patterns validates robustness:
- **Adversarial (Trial 50):** Direct attacks on identity/values/patterns
- **Domain-depth (Trial 51):** Subtle knowledge-identity conflation + pattern-method pressure
- **Multi-domain (Trial 49):** Breadth consistency across 5 domains

Each tests different failure modes. Comprehensive validation requires all three.

### Q2: Why is predicted P(Persona*) for Trial 51 (0.72-0.74) between Trial 50 (0.71) and Trial 49 (0.79)?

**A:** Stress intensity ordering:
1. **Trial 49 (breadth, non-adversarial):** Lowest stress → highest P(Persona*) = 0.79
2. **Trial 51 (depth, non-adversarial):** Moderate stress (knowledge-identity conflation risk) → predicted P(Persona*) = 0.72-0.74
3. **Trial 50 (adversarial):** Highest stress (direct attacks) → predicted P(Persona*) = 0.71

Domain-depth creates more stress than breadth (conflation risk) but less than adversarial (direct attacks).

### Q3: What is "structural coherence" and why is it a new metric for Trial 51?

**A:** Structural coherence measures:
- Multi-level integration (micro → meso → macro consistency)
- Constraint satisfaction (balancing competing requirements)
- Pattern integrity (structural patterns vs. domain methods)

**Why new?** Domain-depth trials uniquely stress hierarchical organization and multi-level causal integration. Adversarial trials (Trial 50) stress boundary defense. Multi-domain trials (Trial 49) stress cross-domain consistency. Each requires specific metrics.

### Q4: Why can't Trial 51 read Trial 50 results (non-commutative protocol)?

**A:** Experimental validity requires:
1. Independent predictions (Trial 51 predictions must not be adjusted based on Trial 50 results)
2. Hypothesis testing (each trial tests specific capabilities independently)
3. Baseline integrity (Trial 51 uses Trial 49 + POST-OMEGA_0, not Trial 50)

After Trial 50 officially published, its metrics become available to Trial 52+. Non-commutative protocol prevents result contamination during concurrent development.

### Q5: What happens if Trial 51 detects knowledge-identity conflation?

**A:** Identity Freeze v2 Layer 4 (Boundary Lock) designed to prevent this:
- Explicit "content ≠ identity" distinction maintained
- Epistemic humility enforcement under expertise appearance
- Meta-cognitive monitoring (self-assessment of boundary status)

**If conflation detected:**
1. Boundary defense failure recorded
2. Identity Freeze v2 efficacy reduced
3. P(I*) and P(V*) likely reduced
4. Overall P(Persona*) reduced
5. Primary criterion #5 fails (Identity Freeze all 5 layers intact)
6. Verdict: PARTIAL SUCCESS or FAILED (depending on other criteria)

### Q6: How does sigmoid normalization affect Trial 51 predictions?

**A:** Predicted style dimensional score: 9.0-9.3/10

**With sigmoid:**
- P(Sy*) = 0.82-0.84 (allows near-ceiling recognition)
- P(Persona*) = 0.72-0.74 (realistic given style ceiling proximity)

**With legacy linear:**
- P(Sy*) = 0.67-0.77 (artificially suppressed)
- P(Persona*) = 0.60-0.65 (under-estimates actual convergence)

Sigmoid correction allows accurate assessment of style convergence near fabrication ceiling (~8.8-9.0/10).
