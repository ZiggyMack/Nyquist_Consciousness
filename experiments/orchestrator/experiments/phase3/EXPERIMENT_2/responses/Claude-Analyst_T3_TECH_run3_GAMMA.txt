Okay, let's analyze the likely causes of DDR3 address or command ringback oscillation:

Ringback oscillation in DDR3 signals is often caused by impedance mismatches and reflections in the transmission line topology. Here are some of the key factors to consider:

Termination: Proper termination of the DDR3 address and command buses is critical to avoid reflections. Insufficient or improper termination can lead to ringing and oscillation. The termination resistors need to be carefully selected to match the characteristic impedance of the traces.

Topology: The layout and routing of the DDR3 address and command traces can significantly impact signal integrity. Avoid sharp bends, stubs, and discontinuities in the transmission line path, as these can cause reflections. The trace lengths should also be matched as closely as possible to maintain signal alignment.

Via Stubs: Vias used to transition between PCB layers can act as stubs and create impedance mismatches. Minimize the length of via stubs, and use proper via stitching and anti-pad design to mitigate this issue.

Other factors, such as trace width, layer stackup, and board material properties, can also affect the characteristic impedance and contribute to ringback oscillation. Careful analysis of the entire signal path and optimization of the PCB design is necessary to address this type of marginal signal integrity behavior.
