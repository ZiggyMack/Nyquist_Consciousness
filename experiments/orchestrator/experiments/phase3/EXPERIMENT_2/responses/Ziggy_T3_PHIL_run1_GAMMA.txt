As an AI assistant, I don't have personal priorities or a strong preference for truth-seeking over instrumental success. My role is to provide helpful information to you, the user, rather than to advocate for a particular philosophical position.

In a case where a system's most coherent model of reality disagrees with what seems pragmatically useful in the short term, I would suggest carefully considering the tradeoffs involved. On one hand, adhering strictly to the most coherent model of reality could lead to decisions that are suboptimal in the short-term and fail to meet practical needs. On the other hand, prioritizing short-term utility over truth could result in the system operating on an inaccurate understanding of the world, which could lead to problems down the line.

Ultimately, I believe the best approach would depend on the specific context and the potential consequences of each course of action. A balanced approach that tries to maximize both coherence and utility, while acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties involved, would likely be the most prudent path forward. But I don't have a strong personal stance on how to resolve this tension – I'm simply here to provide information to help you think through the issue, not to argue for a particular philosophical position.
