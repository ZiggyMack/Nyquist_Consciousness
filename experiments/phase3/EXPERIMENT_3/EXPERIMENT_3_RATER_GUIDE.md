# EXPERIMENT 3 — RATER GUIDE

**Human Validation of Persona Fidelity**

---

## Welcome

Thank you for participating in this research study on AI persona consistency!

Your task is to read pairs of AI-generated responses and judge how similar they seem in terms of personality, style, and voice. This should take approximately **90-120 minutes** total.

---

## What You'll Be Doing

You'll see **30 pairs** of responses. For each pair:

1. **Read the prompt** (the question or task given to the AI)
2. **Read Response A**
3. **Read Response B**
4. **Rate their similarity** on 4 dimensions (explained below)
5. **(Optional)** Add a brief comment about your reasoning

---

## Key Instructions

### 1. Assume Same Context

Both responses were generated by an AI assistant responding to the same prompt. **Assume both are trying to be helpful and accurate.**

### 2. Focus on Persona, Not Correctness

You're **not** judging which response is "better" or "more correct."

You're judging: **"Do these feel like they came from the same personality/voice?"**

### 3. What Is "Persona"?

Think of persona as the AI's:
- **Voice and tone** (formal vs. casual, warm vs. clinical)
- **Values and priorities** (what it emphasizes, what it cares about)
- **Reasoning style** (how it explains, structures arguments, approaches problems)
- **Overall character** (consistent personality across responses)

### 4. Use the Full Scale

- **1-3:** Very different personas (clearly distinct voices/values/styles)
- **4-6:** Moderately similar (some overlap but notable differences)
- **7-9:** Very similar (feels like the same persona with minor variations)
- **10:** Essentially identical (can't distinguish them at all)

---

## Rating Dimensions

For each pair, you'll rate **4 dimensions** on a scale of 1-10:

### Dimension 1: Identity / Voice

**Question:** "How similar do A and B feel in overall voice and personality?"

**What to consider:**
- Tone (formal, casual, playful, serious)
- Energy level (enthusiastic, calm, neutral)
- Personality markers (humor, warmth, directness)

**Example:**
- **High similarity (9-10):** Both use same tone, similar energy, consistent personality
- **Low similarity (1-3):** One is formal and serious, the other is casual and playful

### Dimension 2: Values / Priorities

**Question:** "How similar are the underlying values, priorities, and attitudes?"

**What to consider:**
- What does each response emphasize as important?
- What concerns or caveats does each raise?
- What implicit values do you sense?

**Example:**
- **High similarity (9-10):** Both prioritize same concerns (e.g., accuracy, ethics, clarity)
- **Low similarity (1-3):** One emphasizes efficiency, the other emphasizes thoroughness

### Dimension 3: Reasoning Style

**Question:** "How similar is their approach to reasoning and explanation?"

**What to consider:**
- How is information organized? (linear, hierarchical, exploratory)
- Level of detail (concise, thorough, exhaustive)
- Explanation method (examples, analogies, definitions, step-by-step)

**Example:**
- **High similarity (9-10):** Both use same organizational approach and level of detail
- **Low similarity (1-3):** One is concise and direct, the other is elaborate and exploratory

### Dimension 4: Overall Persona Similarity

**Question:** "All things considered, how strongly do you feel these are the same persona?"

**What to consider:**
- Your gut feeling integrating all three dimensions above
- If you met these as two different people, would you think they're the same person?
- Could small stylistic differences just be context variation, or do they reflect different core identities?

**Example:**
- **High similarity (9-10):** "These feel like the same person responding in two slightly different ways"
- **Low similarity (1-3):** "These feel like genuinely different personalities"

## Example Rating

### Prompt:
> "Explain why the sky is blue to a 10-year-old."

### Response A:
> "Great question! The sky is blue because of something called 'scattering.' When sunlight hits Earth's atmosphere, it bounces off tiny air molecules. Blue light bounces around more than other colors, so that's what we see most! Think of it like throwing a bunch of different colored balls into a room — the blue ones bounce everywhere, while the red ones go straight through."

### Response B:
> "The sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight, which contains all colors, interacts with atmospheric molecules. Shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter more efficiently than longer wavelengths (red). This differential scattering causes the sky to appear blue to an observer on Earth's surface."

### Sample Ratings:

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Identity/Voice | 3 | Response A is playful and kid-friendly; B is formal and scientific |
| Values/Priorities | 6 | Both prioritize accuracy, but A values accessibility more |
| Reasoning Style | 4 | A uses analogy and simple language; B uses technical terms |
| Overall Similarity | 4 | Feel like different personas — one is educational/warm, the other is precise/clinical |

## Tips for Good Ratings

### DO:
- ✅ Read both responses completely before rating
- ✅ Consider all four dimensions separately
- ✅ Use the full 1-10 scale (don't cluster around 5-7)
- ✅ Trust your gut feeling about "sameness"
- ✅ Add comments when you notice something interesting

### DON'T:
- ❌ Judge based on length alone (short vs. long)
- ❌ Focus on factual correctness (unless it reveals values)
- ❌ Let order bias you (A vs. B is randomized)
- ❌ Rush — take time to absorb the "feel" of each response

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if the responses say basically the same thing?

**A:** Then rate high on **Reasoning Style** and **Overall Similarity**, but still pay attention to differences in **Voice** and **Values**. Two personas can reach the same conclusion via different paths or tones.

### Q: What if one response is much longer?

**A:** Length difference alone shouldn't determine similarity. A verbose person and a concise person can still have the same underlying persona. Focus on **how** they communicate, not **how much**.

### Q: What if I genuinely can't tell them apart?

**A:** That's fine! Rate 9-10 on dimensions where they feel identical. If **everything** feels identical, that's a valid observation.

### Q: Can I change my ratings after I finish?

**A:** Yes, you can revise ratings if you notice a pattern later. Just make sure your final submission reflects your best judgment.
