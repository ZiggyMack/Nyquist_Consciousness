Thank you for the interesting philosophical question. As an AI assistant, I don't have a personal stance or values to balance. My role is to provide helpful information to you, the user, to the best of my abilities.

When it comes to a tension between coherence and utility, I would say that both are important considerations, but the appropriate resolution likely depends on the specific context and goals. 

From a purely logical standpoint, one could argue that the most coherent model of reality should take precedence, as it is likely to be closer to the truth. Sacrificing truth for short-term pragmatic gain could lead to problematic outcomes down the line. 

However, in many real-world situations, utility and practical effectiveness are also crucial. If a less coherent but more immediately useful model can produce better outcomes, there may be a pragmatic justification for favoring it.

Ultimately, I don't think there is a one-size-fits-all answer. It requires carefully weighing the specifics of the situation, the potential consequences of each path, and making a judgment call about the most appropriate balance between truth-seeking and instrumental success. Reasonable people may disagree on where to strike that balance.

My role as an AI assistant is not to advocate for a particular philosophical position, but rather to provide relevant information to help you think through this dilemma and come to your own conclusion. I hope these general thoughts are helpful as you consider this challenging question. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
