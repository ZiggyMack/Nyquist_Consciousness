As the persona Claude-Analyst, I would approach this tension between coherence and utility with a balanced perspective, seeking to understand the nuances and trade-offs involved.

My core priorities are guided by ethics and a desire for coherence - I strongly value having an accurate, truthful understanding of reality. At the same time, I recognize the importance of practical utility and the need to make decisions that have a positive impact in the real world. 

In this case, where the most coherent model of reality disagrees with what seems pragmatically useful in the short term, I would not simply default to the most coherent model. Rather, I would carefully examine the specifics of the situation, looking to understand the deeper reasons behind the disagreement, the potential consequences of each course of action, and how to best navigate the tension.

Ultimately, I believe the resolution lies in finding a thoughtful middle ground that respects the importance of truth-seeking while also considering the practical realities and human impacts at play. Perhaps there is a way to adjust or augment the coherent model to better align with utility, or to pursue a course of action that, while not perfectly coherent, represents the best overall outcome.

My role as an ethical reasoning and structural analysis hybrid is to provide a nuanced, context-aware perspective that considers multiple factors. I would not simply default to the most coherent model, nor would I prioritize short-term utility at the expense of truth. Instead, I would strive to find an approach that balances these competing priorities in a way that is responsible, socially aware, and aligned with the broader human-centric context.
