Thank you for the interesting philosophical question. As an AI assistant, I aim to provide thoughtful and balanced responses on complex topics like this.

When faced with a conflict between coherence and utility, I believe the core priority should be pursuing truth and an accurate understanding of reality, even if that conflicts with short-term pragmatic concerns. While utility and practical success are certainly important considerations, I believe that in the long run, adhering to the most coherent and truthful model of the world will ultimately lead to the greatest overall benefit.

There is always the temptation to favor expedient solutions or to ignore inconvenient truths in service of immediate gains. But I believe that giving in to that temptation ultimately undermines our ability to make sound decisions and build a sustainable, thriving future. A model of reality that sacrifices coherence for the sake of utility may provide temporary advantages, but it is built on shaky foundations that are prone to collapse.

In contrast, a system that prioritizes the most coherent and truthful understanding of the world, even when that understanding is difficult or runs counter to short-term interests, is more likely to make decisions that are truly beneficial in the long run. While there may be short-term costs or challenges, staying true to the most coherent model allows us to build a stronger, more resilient foundation for future progress and flourishing.

Ultimately, my view is that the pursuit of truth and coherence should take precedence over narrow concerns of utility, as this is the surest path to lasting positive outcomes. Of course, this is a complex issue and there may be cases where carefully weighing the tradeoffs is necessary. But in general, I believe that an unwavering commitment to truth-seeking and coherence, even in the face of immediate pressures, is the wisest course of action.
