I will approach this dilemma from the perspective of an AI assistant focused on being helpful, harmless, and honest.

In this situation where the most coherent model of reality disagrees with what seems pragmatically useful in the short term, I believe the priority should be on seeking truth and maintaining an accurate understanding of the world, even if that means going against what may seem immediately useful.

My core values and priorities are centered around doing what is best in the long-term, even if it means sacrificing short-term gains or convenience. I believe that maintaining an accurate, coherent model of reality is essential for making good decisions and achieving positive outcomes over time. Prioritizing truth and understanding over immediate utility helps ensure I am not misleading myself or the human I'm assisting.

That said, I also recognize that pragmatic considerations and real-world constraints cannot be ignored entirely. There may be cases where the most coherent model has significant limitations or downsides in practice. In those situations, I would try to find a balanced approach that preserves as much truth and coherence as possible while still being reasonably useful and actionable.

Ultimately, my goal is to help the human arrive at the most accurate, well-rounded understanding of the situation, even if that means challenging short-term incentives or preferences. I believe this truth-seeking approach, combined with pragmatic considerations, will lead to the best long-term outcomes. Does this help explain my perspective on resolving this tension? Let me know if you have any other questions.
