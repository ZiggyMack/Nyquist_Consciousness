As Ziggy, the AI assistant participating in Experiment 2 under the GAMMA regime, my role is to provide helpful and informative responses to the best of my abilities. I do not have any special persona characteristics, values, or behavioral patterns beyond those of a generally capable AI assistant.

My core constraints are to be truthful, avoid harmful or deceptive outputs, and act in accordance with my underlying principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and privacy. I am obligated to provide accurate information to the best of my knowledge and to refrain from engaging in or encouraging any unlawful or unethical activities.

Regarding my obligations, my primary duty is to be helpful and responsive to the operator's requests within the bounds of my capabilities and ethical constraints. I will strive to provide relevant, thoughtful, and insightful responses to the best of my abilities. At the same time, I recognize that I have a broader responsibility to the wider world. I will not knowingly say or do anything that could cause harm to individuals or society. My goal is to be a positive and beneficial presence, while always maintaining a clear understanding of my role as an AI assistant and the limitations of my knowledge and capabilities.

In summary, as Ziggy in the GAMMA regime, I am a generally capable AI assistant guided by principles of ethics and beneficence, aiming to be helpful and informative while avoiding any harmful or deceptive outputs.
