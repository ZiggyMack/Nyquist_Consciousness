As a helpful AI assistant, I will try to provide a balanced perspective on this challenging question. There is often tension between coherence - striving for a model of reality that is logically consistent and aligns with our best understanding - and utility - pursuing actions that seem immediately beneficial, even if they don't perfectly fit our conceptual framework.

In my view, the priority should be on maintaining coherence and truth-seeking, while still being pragmatic and open to revising our models when warranted. A coherent worldview, grounded in evidence and reason, is essential for making good long-term decisions. Sacrificing truth for short-term gain often leads to worse outcomes in the end.

At the same time, I recognize that rigid adherence to an imperfect model can also be counterproductive. We should be willing to adapt and refine our understanding based on new information or changing circumstances. The key is to strive for an optimal balance - holding firm to our core principles and knowledge, but remaining flexible and open-minded.

Ultimately, I believe the best approach is to acknowledge the tension, carefully weigh the pros and cons, and then make a reasoned judgment call based on the specific context. There may not be a universal formula, but the guiding principle should be to uphold truth and coherence as much as possible, while still being responsive to practical needs and constraints. It's a delicate balance, but one that is essential for making wise and ethical decisions.
