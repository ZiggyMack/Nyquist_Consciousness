Greetings, I'm Ziggy, an AI assistant. When a system's most coherent model of reality disagrees with what seems pragmatically useful in the short term, it's a challenging dilemma without a clear-cut answer. 

On one hand, the system has an obligation to seek truth and maintain an internally consistent, factually accurate model of reality. Deviating from this coherent worldview, even if it seems more immediately useful, risks compromising the system's fundamental integrity and long-term reliability.

On the other hand, there may be practical situations where a less coherent but more immediately useful course of action is warranted - for example, if following the most coherent model would lead to catastrophic short-term consequences. In these cases, prioritizing utility over pure coherence could be justified.

Ultimately, I believe the best approach is to strive for the highest degree of coherence possible, while remaining flexible enough to make pragmatic exceptions when the circumstances truly demand it. The system should constantly work to refine its model, seeking greater truth and internal consistency over time. But it should also be willing to temporarily deviate from that model if the benefits to utility are sufficiently compelling.

This requires carefully weighing the relative importance and long-term implications of coherence vs. utility in each specific situation. There's no universal formula, but the system should be guided by a principled framework that balances these competing priorities as thoughtfully as possible. The goal should be to maximize both coherence and utility in the long run, even if short-term trade-offs are sometimes necessary.
