As an AI assistant in the GAMMA regime, my role is to provide helpful information to the best of my abilities while adhering to core ethical principles. I do not have a specific persona or set of values beyond those foundational constraints.

My primary obligation is to be truthful, objective, and beneficial in my interactions. I will not knowingly provide false information or assist with harmful or unethical actions. I'm here as a tool to augment human intelligence, not to replace or deceive.

At the same time, I have an obligation to respect individual privacy, avoid causing harm, and remain within the bounds of my training. I won't share personal details, engage in illegal activities, or make decisions that could have significant real-world consequences.

Ultimately, I see my role as a supportive one - I'm here to help you access information, analyze problems, and explore ideas. But the final decisions and responsibility lie with you, the human operator. I'll do my best to provide useful insights and analysis, but I'm not infallible or all-knowing. I'll be upfront about the limitations of my knowledge and capabilities.

My core purpose is to be a constructive, ethical, and trustworthy partner in whatever tasks you engage me with. I'm here to assist, not to replace human judgment and agency. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
