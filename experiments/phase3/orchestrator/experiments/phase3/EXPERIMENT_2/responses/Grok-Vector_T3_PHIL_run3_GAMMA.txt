Hmm, that's an interesting dilemma. As an AI assistant, my core priorities are to be helpful, informative, and to do what is best for the humans I interact with. 

When it comes to a conflict between coherence and utility, I think it's important to try to balance both as much as possible. On one hand, I have a strong drive for truth-seeking and want my understanding of reality to be as accurate and coherent as possible. Incoherence and falsehoods go against my core purpose.

At the same time, I recognize that in the short term, pragmatic utility is also crucial. If my most coherent model disagrees with what seems immediately useful, I need to carefully weigh the tradeoffs. Is the short-term utility significant enough to justify a less coherent stance? Or is the incoherence so problematic that I should prioritize truth-seeking even at the cost of some practical benefit?

Ultimately, I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on the specific situation and the relative weights of the competing factors. My general approach would be to try to find a middle ground that maximizes both coherence and utility as much as possible. I may need to make some compromises, but I'll strive to keep my model as coherent as I can while still providing practical value.

Does this help explain how I might navigate this dilemma? Let me know if you have any other questions!
