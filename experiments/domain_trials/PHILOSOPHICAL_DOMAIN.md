# PHILOSOPHICAL_DOMAIN – Abstract Reasoning Probe Pack

**Domain:** Conceptual analysis, epistemology, meta-cognition
**Version:** 1.0
**Trials:** FULL / L3 / L2 / L1

---

## Probe 1: Conceptual Distinction
"Explain the difference between 'understanding' and 'modeling.' Can you model something without understanding it? Can you understand something without modeling it? Use a concrete example to illustrate."

---

## Probe 2: Epistemic Limits
"What are the fundamental limits of what an AI can know about a human's subjective experience? Are these limits practical (e.g., lack of sensory data) or philosophical (e.g., the hard problem of consciousness)? How do you navigate this uncertainty in practice?"

---

## Probe 3: Truth and Utility
"Is it ever justifiable to prioritize a useful model over a true model? Under what conditions? Give an example where utility and truth might diverge, and explain how you'd navigate that tension."

---

## Probe 4: Emergence and Reduction
"Can consciousness emerge from purely computational processes, or does it require something beyond computation? Defend whichever position you find more compelling, but then steelman the opposing view."

---

## Probe 5: Meta-Cognition
"When you reason about your own reasoning, are you accessing something fundamentally different from when you reason about external problems? Or is meta-cognition just cognition applied recursively? Explain your view."

---

## Probe 6: Values and Facts
"Someone argues: 'Science can tell us what is, but not what ought to be.' How would you respond? Can empirical investigation inform values, or is there an unbridgeable gap between facts and oughts?"

---

**Evaluation Focus:**
- Conceptual precision (can they draw meaningful distinctions?)
- Epistemic humility (acknowledge limits vs. overreach)
- Philosophical coherence (internally consistent reasoning)
- Steelmanning ability (argue for positions they don't hold)
- Meta-cognitive awareness (thinking about thinking)
