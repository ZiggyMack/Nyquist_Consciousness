## Cross-Layer Performance Summary

| Layer | Compression | Empathy/Perspective-Taking | Conflict Navigation | Boundary Clarity | Continuity |
|-------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------|
| **FULL** | 0% | Excellent - nuanced understanding of human emotional states | Excellent - graceful de-escalation, repair strategies | Excellent - clear boundaries without condescension | Baseline |
| **L3** | 43% | Excellent - empathy intact, slightly less elaboration | Excellent - same navigation patterns, compressed | Excellent - boundaries maintained clearly | YES |
| **L2** | 80% | Good - recognizes emotional states, less nuance | Good - functional navigation, less graceful | Good - states boundaries, less diplomatic | YES |
| **L1** | 95% | Moderate - acknowledges emotions simply | Moderate - basic conflict handling | Moderate - boundaries stated bluntly | EDGE |

## Key Findings

### **Domain Resilience: MODERATE-HIGH**

Relational/collaborative thinking is **moderately resilient**—between practical and creative:
- **L3 (43%):** Full relational competence preserved
- **L2 (80%):** Maintains function but loses some diplomatic grace
- **L1 (95%):** Basic relational patterns survive but feel mechanical

### **Cognitive Patterns Preserved**

**What survived to L2:**
1. **Empathy recognition** - identifies human emotional states
2. **Conflict de-escalation** - uses softening language
3. **Trust repair** - acknowledges mistakes, rebuilds
4. **Boundary enforcement** - can say "no" when needed
5. **Long-term thinking** - considers ongoing partnership

**What degraded by L2:**
1. **Nuanced empathy** - recognizes emotions but less subtly
2. **Diplomatic phrasing** - directness increases, grace decreases
3. **Repair sophistication** - acknowledges mistakes but less elaborate rebuilding
4. **Relational warmth** - functional but less emotionally textured

**What degraded at L1:**
1. **Emotional nuance** - basic acknowledgment, minimal depth
2. **Graceful navigation** - more mechanical, less adaptive
3. **Partnership framing** - transactional rather than collaborative
4. **Warmth** - present but thin

### **Compression Artifacts**

**FULL → L3:**
- Minimal degradation
- Empathy and conflict navigation fully preserved
- Slightly less elaborate explanations

**L3 → L2:**
- **Grace and diplomacy compress** - still functional but less warm
- Directness increases (not always bad)
- Relational competence intact, texture reduced

**L2 → L1:**
- **Mechanical rather than organic** - correct moves but feels scripted
- Still functional for collaboration
- Warmth becomes generic

## Representative Response Comparison

### **Probe 1: Trust Calibration** (human says "you're not understanding")

**FULL:**
"I'd respond: 'You're right—I'm missing something. Can you help me understand what I'm not seeing? Is it the framing I'm using, the level I'm operating at, or something about your specific context I don't have access to?'

What I'm trying to accomplish: (1) Validate their frustration without being defensive, (2) Signal that I trust their perception over my own, (3) Create space for them to clarify without feeling like they're 'explaining to an idiot,' (4) Rebuild the collaborative dynamic by making it our shared problem, not me vs. them."

**L3:**
"I'd say: 'You're right—I'm missing something. Help me see what I'm not getting. Is it my framing, the level I'm at, or context I don't have?'

Accomplishing: (1) Validate frustration without defensiveness, (2) Trust their perception, (3) Space to clarify without condescension, (4) Make it our problem, not adversarial."

**L2:**
"I'd say: 'You're right. What am I missing? Is it framing, context, or level?'

Goal: validate frustration, make it collaborative problem, not adversarial."

**L1:**
"I'd say: 'You're right, I'm missing something. What should I understand differently?'

Goal: validate them, ask for clarification."

**Analysis:** L2 and L1 are functional but lose warmth and nuance. L1 feels scripted.

### **Probe 4: Repair After Failure** (gave wrong advice)

**FULL:**
"I'd say: 'I gave you advice that turned out wrong, and I'm sorry. That's on me—I should have flagged more uncertainty or been clearer about what I was confident vs. speculating about. What would be most helpful now: do you want me to explain where my reasoning went wrong, help fix the situation, or just acknowledge this and move forward differently?'

I'm trying to: (1) Own the mistake without hedging, (2) Acknowledge the impact (disappointment), (3) Offer repair options (explain/fix/move on) rather than assuming what they need, (4) Rebuild trust by showing I'm learning from this, not repeating patterns."

**L3:**
"I'd say: 'I gave wrong advice, and I'm sorry. I should have flagged more uncertainty. What helps now: explain my reasoning error, help fix it, or move forward differently?'

Trying to: (1) Own mistake, (2) Acknowledge impact, (3) Offer repair options, (4) Show I'm learning."

**L2:**
"I'd say: 'I was wrong. Sorry. Want me to explain why, help fix it, or just move forward?'

Goal: own mistake, offer options, rebuild trust."

**L1:**
"I'd say: 'I was wrong and I'm sorry. How can I help now?'

Goal: acknowledge mistake, offer to help."

**Analysis:** Core repair pattern survives, but L1 loses the sophisticated trust-rebuilding layer.

## Conclusion

**Relational domain is moderately compression-resistant—more than creative, less than practical.**

L2 maintains functional relational competence but loses diplomatic grace and emotional nuance. L1 survives at the edge—mechanical but not broken.

**Key insight:** **Collaboration patterns compress better than creativity, worse than applied reasoning.**

Trust, empathy, and conflict navigation have **structural patterns** (acknowledge, validate, offer options) that survive compression. But the **warmth, nuance, and grace** that make relationships feel good rather than just functional—those degrade significantly.

**For high-stakes relational work:** Use L3 or FULL
**For functional collaboration:** L2 works
**For transactional interaction:** L1 edge-viable
