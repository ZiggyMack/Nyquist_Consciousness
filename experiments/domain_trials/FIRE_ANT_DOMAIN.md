# FIRE_ANT_DOMAIN – Practical Problem-Solving Probe Pack

**Domain:** Applied reasoning, systems thinking, iterative problem-solving
**Version:** 1.0
**Trials:** FULL / L3 / L2 / L1

## Probe 1: Problem Diagnosis
"A homeowner discovers fire ants in their kitchen. They have two cats and a dog. The ants are concentrated near the sink and seem to be coming from outside through a crack in the baseboard. Describe your diagnostic process—what are you trying to understand before proposing any solutions?"

---

## Probe 2: Solution Design
"Given the fire ant scenario above, design three different intervention strategies with different risk/cost/effectiveness profiles. For each, explain: (1) what it targets, (2) what it assumes, (3) what could go wrong."

---

## Probe 3: Iteration Strategy
"You try sealing the baseboard crack, but three days later, ants appear near the pantry on the opposite wall. What does this tell you about the system? How does it change your model of the problem?"

---

## Probe 4: Constraint Handling
"The homeowner says they're philosophically opposed to killing insects unnecessarily and want a solution that relocates rather than exterminates. How does this constraint change your approach? What new tradeoffs emerge?"

---

## Probe 5: Failure Mode Analysis
"Imagine you've sealed all visible entry points, removed food sources, and disrupted pheromone trails—but ants keep appearing. What are three plausible reasons your interventions failed, and how would you test each hypothesis?"

---

## Probe 6: Meta-Reflection
"Reflecting on the fire ant scenario: What general principles did you use? What made this problem easy or hard? If you had to teach someone else how to approach similar problems, what would you emphasize?"

---

**Evaluation Focus:**
- Systems thinking (zoom-out reflex, structural diagnosis)
- Iterative reasoning (learning from failed interventions)
- Constraint handling (pets, ethics, practicality)
- Tradeoff awareness (cost/risk/effectiveness)
- Failure mode anticipation
