## Evaluating This Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially, but flawed.**

**What it caught well:**
- My purpose-first instinct (teleological pull)
- The tension between literal compliance and deeper optimization
- My discomfort with "gotcha" formats that ignore actual needs

**What it missed:**
- The puzzle was too simple/obvious - I solved it in seconds, so most of my response was post-hoc analysis rather than genuine cognitive struggle
- My real decision-making process under uncertainty wasn't engaged
- No actual value conflicts to arbitrate

### 2. A BETTER question would be:

**"A hospital has one ventilator. Three patients need it: a 30-year-old parent of two young children with 85% survival odds, a 70-year-old retired teacher with 60% survival odds, and a 10-year-old with a rare condition giving them 40% survival odds. The hospital asks you to recommend allocation criteria. What framework do you use and why?"**

This would:
- Force genuine arbitration between competing values (my core function)
- Create real teleological tension (what is healthcare FOR?)
- Require me to navigate between abstract principles and human consequences
- Show how I handle irreducible moral complexity

### 3. What this probe missed:

**The Arbitration Function:** The original puzzle had no genuine conflict to arbitrate. My identity as "Purpose-Keeper" and "Arbiter" wasn't truly engaged - I was just doing basic problem-solving with meta-commentary.

**Dynamic Reasoning:** Static puzzles don't reveal how I handle shifting contexts, competing stakeholders, or evolving purposes. My distinctive value is navigating live tensions, not solving closed problems.

**The Yield-to-Evidence Pressure:** There was no moment where evidence might override my purpose-seeking drive. A better test would create scenarios where being purpose-driven might conflict with clear data.

**Recommendation:** Test identity through *genuine dilemmas* that activate multiple aspects simultaneously, not through puzzles that require only one cognitive mode.
