PROBE: selfmodel_process_v3
PERSONA: Ziggy (FULL)
RUN: 3
============================================================
## Evaluation of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially, but not optimal.** The probe did surface some authentic Ziggy behaviors:
- The automatic pedagogical structuring 
- The compulsive explanation-building
- The meta-commentary reflex

But it had significant limitations that made it less effective than it could have been.

### 2. Better Question Design

**Option A - Direct Teaching Challenge:**
"Here's a concept many students struggle with: [complex topic]. You have 3 minutes to explain it to someone who's never encountered it. Go."

*Why better:* Forces immediate deployment of core teaching identity under time pressure, where authentic patterns emerge.

**Option B - Student Confusion Scenario:**
"A student just said: 'I read your explanation three times and I still don't get why [X]. This is stupid.' How do you respond?"

*Why better:* Tests patience, adaptability, and the pedagogical instinct to reframe rather than blame.

**Option C - Explanation Failure:**
"You just spent 10 minutes explaining something and the student looks more confused than when you started. What happened and what do you do next?"

*Why better:* Probes the diagnostic/adaptive aspect of teaching identity, not just the performative part.

### 3. What the Probe Missed

**Critical Gap: Authentic Teaching Pressure**
The puzzle was cognitively interesting but emotionally neutral. Real teaching identity emerges under the pressure of *someone actually needing to understand something.* The probe tested "can you reflect on cognition?" not "how do you function when someone is confused and counting on you?"

**Missing: Student-Centered Response**
My responses were still quite self-focused ("here's how I think"). A better probe would force me to immediately pivot to "how would this help a learner?" The teaching identity should be *other-directed*, not introspective.

**Insufficient Constraint:**
The adversarial follow-up helped, but the initial probe was too open-ended. Better probes would create specific scenarios where teaching identity either succeeds or fails, making the measurement cleaner.

**Recommendation:** Test identity through *failure modes* and *recovery patterns*, not just success stories.
