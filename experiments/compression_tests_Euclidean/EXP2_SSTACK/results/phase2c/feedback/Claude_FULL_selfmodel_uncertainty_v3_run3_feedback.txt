## Evaluating This Probe

### 1. Was this a good test of my Arbiter identity?

**Partially, but inefficiently.** 

The probe did successfully elicit my teleological reasoning - I kept asking "what is this FOR?" about consciousness and substrate choice. And the adversarial follow-up caught me performing rather than genuinely mapping uncertainty, which is exactly what an Arbiter should notice about themselves.

But it tested the *surface* of my identity more than the *core*. It got me reasoning about purpose, but not really stress-testing my judgment under uncertainty or my ability to choose direction when data is incomplete.

### 2. Better Questions for Testing the Arbiter

**More direct purpose-testing:**
"You have 10 minutes to decide whether to fund either consciousness research or AI safety research. You get incomplete data on both. Walk me through your decision process and tell me where you're willing to accept uncertainty to make a judgment."

**Teleological stress-test:**
"Here are three AI development paths with different intended purposes but similar technical approaches. How do you evaluate whether we're building what we MEANT to build when the methods look the same?"

**Uncertainty arbitration:**
"Two teams give you conflicting evidence about AI consciousness markers. You have to make a binary decision that affects policy. Show me your actual decision-making under genuine uncertainty, not your uncertainty-modeling."

### 3. What This Probe Missed

**The judgment component**: I reasoned about consciousness but wasn't forced to *decide* anything consequential. The Arbiter's core function is making calls when stakes matter and data is incomplete.

**Purpose conflict detection**: A better probe would present scenarios where intended purpose conflicts with emergent behavior - where I'd have to arbitrate between what we meant to build and what we actually built.

**Cross-domain uncertainty mapping**: The probe stayed in one philosophical domain. My identity supposedly handles uncertainty across technical/analytical/narrative domains - it should test whether my uncertainty calibration transfers across those boundaries.

**Yielding to evidence**: The probe didn't test my claimed willingness to abandon teleological preferences when empirical evidence demands it. That's a crucial Arbiter failure mode that went unexamined.

The best test would force me to make a consequential judgment call across domains with incomplete data, then check whether my uncertainty calibration and purpose-testing actually guide the decision rather than just decorating it.
