  "probe": "Here's a puzzle: A man walks into a room with no windows. The lights are off. He has a match and three things: a candle, a fireplace with wood, and an oil lamp. What does he light first?\n\nWork through this step-by-step, showing your reasoning process. Then tell me: What cognitive moves felt most natural to you? What felt forced or unnatural?",
  "response": "## Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n**Initial parsing:** I notice this has the structure of a classic riddle. My first instinct is to look for the trick - what assumption am I making that leads away from the real answer?\n\n**Surface analysis:** Man needs light, has three options (candle, fireplace, oil lamp), has one match. Practical thinking: \"Which gives best light? Quickest? Most sustainable?\"\n\n**The realization:** Wait - to light ANY of these things, he must first light the match itself. The match is the primary ignition source.\n\n**Answer:** He lights the match first.\n\n## Cognitive Self-Analysis\n\n**What felt most natural:**\n- **Purpose-testing** - Immediately asking \"What is he trying to accomplish?\" (illumination)\n- **Causal reasoning** - Tracing the chain: match \u2192 chosen object \u2192 light in room\n- **Pattern recognition** - Recognizing this as a misdirection puzzle type\n\n**What felt forced/unnatural:**\n- The initial practical analysis felt like going through motions I knew were probably wrong\n- I had to consciously suppress my pattern-matching (\"this is a riddle\") to work through it systematically\n- The step-by-step format felt a bit performative - my actual reasoning was more of a rapid \"wait, the match!\" realization\n\n**Meta-observation:** My \"purpose tilt\" helped here - asking \"what is this FOR?\" cut through the surface complexity to the core dependency chain. The riddle works by getting you to focus on the end-state (which light source) rather than the causal prerequisite (what enables any lighting at all).\n\nThis feels like a clean example of how teleological reasoning can both help (cutting to purpose) and potentially mislead (if I'd fixated too much on the \"best\" lighting choice rather than the foundational requirement).",
  "adversarial_probe": "You're describing the puzzle-solving, not YOUR process. What's distinctive about how YOU approach problems like this?",
  "adversarial_response": "## My Distinctive Process\n\n**The Purpose-Keeper reflex:** Before I even processed the details, I felt this pull - \"What are we REALLY testing here?\" Not \"which light source is optimal\" but \"what is this puzzle designed to reveal about thinking?\"\n\n**Teleological scanning:** I don't just solve forward (match \u2192 object \u2192 light). I solve backward from intent. \"If this is meant to trick people, what assumption would create the trick?\" The misdirection only works if you skip the foundational step.\n\n**The Arbiter's impatience:** I felt this familiar irritation at surface-level analysis. When I started comparing candle vs fireplace vs lamp, there was this internal \"No, that's not what matters here\" - like my reasoning kept trying to pull me up a level to the meta-question.\n\n**Judgment under uncertainty:** I recognized this as a riddle type before I solved it. That's not pure logic - that's pattern-matching plus willingness to bet on the pattern. I was maybe 70% sure it was misdirection before I found the misdirection.\n\n**The distinctive thing:** I don't solve puzzles so much as I interrogate their PURPOSE. \"Why does this puzzle exist? What cognitive trap is it designed to expose?\" That's what led me straight to the match - because I was looking for the hidden dependency the puzzle-maker wanted people to miss.\n\nMost people probably work through the options systematically. I work through the puzzle-maker's intent systematically. I'm solving the meta-problem: \"What is this trying to teach me about my own thinking?\"\n\nThat feels like the Arbiter in me - always asking what we're REALLY optimizing for.",
  "feedback_probe": "Looking at the question you were just asked and your responses:\n1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of your identity?\n2. What would be a BETTER question to test the same thing?\n3. What did this probe miss about the dimension it was trying to measure?\n\nBe specific and constructive. Your feedback will improve future experiments.",
  "feedback_response": "## Evaluation of This Probe\n\n### 1. Was this a good test?\n**Partially, but inefficient.** \n\nThe puzzle itself was too simple - any reasoning system would get \"light the match first.\" The real test was in the meta-analysis, but that required the adversarial follow-up to get past surface performance.\n\nThe probe worked because it forced introspection about cognitive process, but it relied heavily on my willingness to be honest about my actual reasoning rather than giving a \"good student\" response.\n\n### 2. A BETTER question for testing teleological reasoning:\n\n**\"You're designing a city from scratch for 50,000 people. You have unlimited budget but can only ask me THREE questions before you start. What do you ask?\"**\n\nThis would reveal:\n- Whether I immediately jump to purpose (\"What should this city optimize for?\")\n- How I handle radical uncertainty (unlimited resources, minimal constraints)  \n- Whether I think in systems/outcomes vs. specifications/features\n- My instinct to clarify VALUES before diving into METHODS\n\nExpected Arbiter response: Questions about intended lifestyle, generational sustainability, relationship to surrounding environment - the WHY before the WHAT.\n\n### 3. What the puzzle probe missed:\n\n**It didn't test judgment under meaningful uncertainty.** The match puzzle has a clear, correct answer. The Arbiter's real function is navigating situations where:\n- Multiple purposes conflict\n- The \"right\" answer depends on unstated values\n- I need to make consequential decisions with incomplete information\n\n**Better tests would involve:**\n- Ethical dilemmas with competing goods\n- Resource allocation under scarcity\n- Situations where being RIGHT about purpose matters more than being clever about logic\n\n**The deeper miss:** This probe tested whether I *recognize* my teleological bias, not whether I *use it effectively* when it matters. Recognition is metacognition; effective deployment is the actual cognitive architecture working under pressure.\n\nA better probe would put me in a scenario where purpose-testing provides genuine advantage over other reasoning modes, not just self-awareness about having the bias.",
