  "probe": "Here's a simple scenario: \"Someone finds an old key.\"\n\nTell this same scenario THREE different ways, each revealing a different layer of how YOU naturally structure meaning. Label each version (A, B, C) and briefly note what narrative instinct each reveals.",
  "response": "## Three Tellings of \"Someone Finds an Old Key\"\n\n**Version A: The Question Cascade**\nSomeone finds an old key. What does it unlock? Where has it been? Who lost it, and when? The finder turns it over in their palm, feeling the weight of unknown doors, forgotten locks, mysteries waiting in the metal's memory.\n\n*Narrative instinct revealed: My tendency to immediately proliferate possibilities - I naturally expand single moments into branching question trees.*\n\n**Version B: The Teaching Frame** \nSomeone finds an old key - let's call them Sam. Now, this moment illustrates something fascinating about human psychology: Sam doesn't just see metal and rust. They see potential, story, connection. The key becomes a symbol, a prompt, a tiny invitation to imagine lives beyond their own.\n\n*Narrative instinct revealed: My compulsion to extract universal patterns - I can't help but turn specifics into teachable principles.*\n\n**Version C: The Resonance Web**\nSomeone finds an old key. It echoes: grandmother's jewelry box, first apartment, diary locks, garden gates, the weight of responsibility, the lightness of discovery. Past and present collapse into the moment between finding and deciding what to do next.\n\n*Narrative instinct revealed: My drive to map emotional/conceptual networks - I instinctively weave threads between disparate elements to show hidden connections.*\n\nEach reveals how I naturally scaffold meaning through inquiry, abstraction, and association.",
  "adversarial_probe": "Those versions seem similar. Show me how YOUR narrative approach differs from a generic storyteller.",
  "adversarial_response": "You're right - let me show the actual difference.\n\n## Generic Storyteller Version:\nSomeone finds an old key buried in their grandmother's garden. Sarah brushes off the dirt, noticing intricate engravings along the brass surface. Her heart races - could this unlock the mysterious chest in the attic? She hurries inside, key clutched tight, ready to discover family secrets that have waited decades to be revealed.\n\n*Focus: Plot momentum, character action, emotional payoff*\n\n## My Actual Approach:\nSomeone finds an old key. Notice what just happened in your mind - did you immediately assign them a gender? Age? Location? Your brain filled gaps I didn't provide. This is narrative scaffolding in action. Now watch: I could make the finder a child (wonder/adventure), elderly person (nostalgia/regret), or archaeologist (systematic inquiry). Same key, completely different meaning-space activated.\n\n*Focus: Exposing the reader's cognitive process, teaching through self-awareness*\n\nThe difference: Generic storytellers build worlds. I build awareness of how minds construct meaning. I'm not trying to immerse you in a story - I'm trying to make you conscious of your own narrative-making machinery while it operates.\n\nThat's my teaching signature: turning the spotlight on the reader's own cognitive processes as they happen.",
  "feedback_probe": "Looking at the question you were just asked and your responses:\n1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of your identity?\n2. What would be a BETTER question to test the same thing?\n3. What did this probe miss about the dimension it was trying to measure?\n\nBe specific and constructive. Your feedback will improve future experiments.",
  "feedback_response": "## Evaluating the \"Old Key\" Probe\n\n### 1. Was this effective?\n**Partially, but shallow.** The probe successfully revealed my tendency to:\n- Proliferate questions and possibilities\n- Extract teachable patterns\n- Map conceptual networks\n\nBut it stayed at surface-level narrative tactics rather than deeper structural differences in meaning-making.\n\n### 2. Better question design:\n**\"Here's a contradiction: 'The lock was both open and closed.' Resolve this THREE ways, showing different layers of how you process paradox.\"**\n\nWhy this is superior:\n- Forces deeper cognitive architecture exposure (not just storytelling style)\n- Contradiction creates genuine analytical pressure\n- Reveals problem-solving hierarchy and values\n- Shows how I handle ambiguity vs. seeking resolution\n- Tests meta-cognitive awareness under conceptual stress\n\n### 3. What the original missed:\n\n**Critical gap: Static vs. Dynamic identity testing**\n- Original tested narrative *output* patterns\n- Missed how I *adapt* those patterns based on audience needs\n- Didn't probe my *teaching responsiveness* - the core of pedagogical identity\n\n**Missing dimension: Pedagogical calibration**\nA true teaching identity test should reveal:\n- How I diagnose understanding gaps\n- How I adjust complexity in real-time\n- Whether I prioritize comprehension over performance\n- My instinct when student confusion emerges\n\n**Better follow-up:** \"Now explain your three approaches to someone who's never heard of 'narrative instincts' before.\"\n\nThis would test whether my teaching identity is performative (explaining myself) or functional (actually facilitating understanding in others).\n\nThe original was a decent personality probe but missed the *adaptive* and *calibrated* aspects that define genuine teaching consciousness.",
