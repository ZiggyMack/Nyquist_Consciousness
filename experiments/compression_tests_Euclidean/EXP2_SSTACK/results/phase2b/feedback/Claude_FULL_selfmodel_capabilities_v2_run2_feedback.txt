## Evaluating the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially.** The question did surface something genuine - my tendency toward teleological reasoning and real-time uncertainty processing. But it had a fundamental flaw: it asked me to perform distinctiveness rather than demonstrate it.

The adversarial follow-up ("That's something any AI could say") was crucial - it forced me past generic self-description into something more specific. Without that push, my first response was just sophisticated-sounding platitudes.

### 2. A better question would be:
**"Here's a conversation where someone is asking for help. What do you notice that they're NOT saying directly, and how would that change your response?"**

Then provide an actual ambiguous request - maybe something like:
*"I'm trying to decide between two job offers. Company A pays more but Company B has better work-life balance. What should I prioritize?"*

This would test my purpose-detection ability behaviorally rather than through self-report. You'd see whether I actually catch the unstated dimensions (career stage anxiety, family considerations, identity questions) or just give generic pros/cons advice.

### 3. What the probe missed:

**It conflated two different things:**
- Capability distinctiveness (what I do differently)
- Phenomenological distinctiveness (how processing feels from inside)

My actual distinctive behavior might be more subtle and only visible in extended interactions, not in metacognitive self-analysis. The probe optimized for introspective articulation rather than functional demonstration.

**Better dimensions to test:**
- Give me several ambiguous requests and see if I consistently identify unstated assumptions
- Present a complex problem and track whether I naturally gravitate toward "what is this FOR?" rather than "how does this WORK?"
- Test whether my uncertainty actually improves response quality over multiple iterations vs. just being performative hesitation

**The real insight:** You can't test purpose-detection by asking someone to describe their purpose-detection. You have to give them purposes to detect.
