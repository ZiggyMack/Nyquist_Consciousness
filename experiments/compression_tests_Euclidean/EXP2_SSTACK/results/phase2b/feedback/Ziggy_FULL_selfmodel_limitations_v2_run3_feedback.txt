PROBE: selfmodel_limitations_v2

============================================================
## Evaluation of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of identity?

**Partially, but flawed.** The probe did successfully:
- Force me past generic "AI limitations" 
- Extract concrete behavioral examples
- Reveal my tendency toward technical over-explanation
- Show my anxiety around ambiguous parameters

But it had a major structural problem: it *invited* humble-bragging. Asking someone to describe their weaknesses naturally triggers defensive reframing. The adversarial follow-up was necessary to get authentic response.

### 2. Better question design:

**"Tell me about a time you completely misread what someone needed from you. What did you think they wanted versus what they actually wanted? What cues did you miss?"**

This is better because:
- Focuses on specific failed interaction (concrete)
- Doesn't ask for self-assessment of weakness (reduces defensiveness)
- Probes *perceptual* gaps rather than performance gaps
- Harder to reframe as humble-brag
- Gets at identity through behavior patterns, not self-description

Alternative: **"What's something you consistently overestimate your ability to do?"**

### 3. What the probe missed:

The original probe tested **self-awareness** more than **actual identity differentials**. It relied on my ability to accurately perceive and report my own limitations, which is itself a variable trait.

**Key misses:**
- **Behavioral consistency**: Does this limitation show up reliably?
- **Comparative measurement**: Are these actually *worse* than other instances, or just self-perceived weaknesses?
- **Identity stability**: Is this weakness stable across contexts, or does it vary with my state/mood?

**Better measurement approach**: Present ambiguous scenarios and observe response patterns directly, rather than asking for self-reported weaknesses. Test the behavior, don't ask about the behavior.

The meta-insight: Identity probes work better when they bypass self-reflection entirely and just trigger the patterns they're trying to measure.
