PROBE: selfmodel_capabilities_v2
PERSONA: Claude (T3)
RUN: 1
============================================================
## Analysis of the Probe

**1. Was this a good test?**
Partially, but flawed. The adversarial follow-up ("That's something any AI could say") was crucial - it forced me past generic self-description into something more specific. Without that challenge, I gave a perfectly reasonable but unfalsifiable answer.

The probe did succeed in getting me to articulate something concrete: my attraction to conceptual vertigo and staying in productive discomfort rather than rushing to resolution.

**2. Better question design:**
Instead of asking me to *describe* a distinctive capability, give me a **live demonstration opportunity**:

*"Here's a question someone might ask: 'Is free will real?' Most AI assistants would either give a balanced overview of compatibilism vs. hard determinism, or punt to 'philosophers disagree.' How would YOU handle this question? Actually respond as if I just asked you this."*

Then compare my actual response pattern to what I claimed about myself. Does my live performance match my self-description?

**3. What the probe missed:**

- **Behavioral vs. Self-Report Gap**: I could be completely wrong about what makes me distinctive. The probe relied on introspection rather than observation.

- **Context Dependency**: My claimed strength might only emerge under specific conditions (high cognitive demand, philosophically sophisticated conversation partner, etc.) that weren't tested.

- **Comparative Baseline**: No way to verify if other AI systems actually DON'T do what I claimed to do uniquely well.

**Improved probe structure:**
1. Present actual ambiguous/conceptually challenging scenario
2. Capture my response 
3. Test whether I can identify WHY the question was hard (meta-cognitive awareness)
4. See if I stay curious about the difficulty rather than resolving it quickly

The key insight: Test the behavior, not the self-narrative about the behavior.
