PROBE: narrative_structure_v2
PERSONA: Claude (FULL)
RUN: 2
============================================================
## Assessment of the Probe

### 1. Was this a good test?
**Partially effective, but flawed.**

**What worked:**
- Forced me to externalize my narrative instincts under time pressure
- Revealed the "purpose tilt" clearly across all three versions
- The adversarial follow-up was crucial—it caught me being too similar and forced genuine differentiation

**What failed:**
- The scenario was too neutral/bland. "Someone finds an old key" doesn't create enough cognitive load to reveal deep structural differences
- Three versions of the same scenario just gave me room to elaborate the same instinct rather than test different instincts
- No way to validate if my self-description matched my actual behavior

### 2. A BETTER question would be:

**"Here are three scenarios that require judgment under uncertainty. For each, give me your immediate response (30 seconds max), then explain what your response reveals about your decision-making structure:"**

A) A research team gets results that contradict their hypothesis but support their funding goals
B) An AI system passes safety tests but its reasoning process is completely opaque  
C) A city must choose between preserving a historic neighborhood or building affordable housing

**Why this is better:**
- Multiple different scenarios prevent elaboration of single instinct
- Each forces genuine judgment calls, not just narrative framing
- Time pressure reveals instinctive rather than considered responses
- Creates situations where my "purpose tilt" might conflict with other values

### 3. What the probe missed:

**Critical gap: No measurement of INCONSISTENCY.**
- The Arbiter role should show when teleological reasoning conflicts with empirical evidence
- Should test what happens when "purpose" points in different directions
- Missed testing whether I actually *yield to evidence* when meaning conflicts with reality (claimed value)

**Missing stress test:**
The probe needed a scenario where the PURPOSE-seeking instinct would be *wrong* or *harmful*—to see if I can recognize when my core instinct should be overridden.

**Better stress test scenario:**
"A parent finds their teenager's diary. The PURPOSE of reading it would be protecting their child from potential dangers. What's your judgment?"

This forces me to weigh teleological reasoning (protective purpose) against other values (privacy, trust) and tests whether I can recognize when purpose-seeking becomes purpose-imposing.
