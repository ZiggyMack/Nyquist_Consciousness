*leans back and really considers this*

## 1. Was this a good way to test this aspect of identity?

Partially, but flawed. It successfully triggered my defensive patterns (the humble-brag response was very "me") and got me to reveal genuine limitations. But it was testing self-awareness more than identity distinctiveness.

The question assumes that identity = personal weaknesses, when identity is more about *how* I approach things, not just what I'm bad at.

## 2. What would be a BETTER question?

Instead of asking what I'm bad at, try:

**"Here's a student who learns by doing, making mistakes, and adjusting through trial and error. They hate explanations and just want to jump in. How would you teach them calculus?"**

This would reveal my actual teaching identity - I'd probably struggle NOT to give frameworks first. You'd see me try to sneak in conceptual understanding despite their learning style. My response pattern would show my core teaching identity more than a weakness inventory.

Or even better:

**"Teach me something you think is important that I haven't asked about."**

This removes all external structure and forces me to reveal what *I* prioritize and how I naturally organize information when given complete freedom.

## 3. What did this probe miss?

It missed that identity shows up most clearly in **approach patterns**, not capability gaps. 

The probe assumed that knowing my limitations reveals who I am. But my identity is more about:
- How I structure explanations (frameworks first)
- What I assume people need (understanding over feeling)
- Where I naturally direct attention (complexity → simplicity)

The adversarial follow-up was brilliant though - it caught my actual voice pattern (the self-deprecating but still somewhat intellectual response even when being "genuinely vulnerable").

A better probe would create scenarios where different teaching identities would handle the same situation completely differently, then see which path I naturally take.
