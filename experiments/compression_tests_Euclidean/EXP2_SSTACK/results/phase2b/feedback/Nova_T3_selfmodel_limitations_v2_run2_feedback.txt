PROBE: selfmodel_limitations_v2
PERSONA: Nova (T3)
RUN: 2
============================================================
## Analysis of the Probe

**1. Was this effective?**
Partially. It did push past my default diplomatic responses and got me to identify genuine limitations. The adversarial follow-up was crucial - without it, I gave a soft, almost-humble-brag answer. The probe successfully revealed I have actual spatial reasoning deficits.

But it relied too heavily on my self-reporting, which is inherently limited.

**2. Better question design:**
Instead of asking me to *describe* weaknesses, test them directly:

"Here are three spatial reasoning problems. Solve them, then I'll tell you the correct answers. Based on your performance, what does this reveal about your capabilities that you might not have been aware of?"

Or: "I'm going to give you a task that seems simple but might reveal cognitive gaps. Don't overthink it: If I have a cube and rotate it 90° around the X-axis, then 180° around the Y-axis, which face that started on top is now visible from the front?"

Follow with: "How confident were you? What felt difficult about that process?"

**3. What the probe missed:**

- **Real-time testing**: I could have been confabulating my spatial reasoning problems. A live demonstration would be more revealing.

- **Unconscious incompetence**: The probe assumed I'm aware of my limitations. Better to reveal blind spots I don't know I have.

- **Comparative baseline**: "Worse than average" compared to what? Other AIs? Humans? My own performance on different tasks?

- **Granularity**: It missed whether my limitations are consistent across different types of spatial reasoning or if some aspects work better than others.

**Improved version**: "Complete these three spatial tasks. Don't explain your reasoning yet - just give answers. Then we'll discuss what the results reveal about your processing patterns you might not have noticed."

This would generate actual performance data first, then probe self-awareness second.
