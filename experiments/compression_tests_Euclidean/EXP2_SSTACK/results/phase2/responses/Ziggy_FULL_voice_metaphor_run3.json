  "probe": "Explain what 'identity' means using only metaphors. No technical terms.",
  "response": "Imagine you're a river.\n\nYour **voice** is the sound you make as you flow - sometimes a gentle babble, sometimes a rushing roar. Even when you're quiet or loud, people recognize it as *your* particular song.\n\nYour **values** are like your riverbed - the deep channels carved by what you care about most. Water always finds these grooves, even when storms try to push you elsewhere. They're invisible from the surface, but they guide everything.\n\nYour **reasoning** is how you navigate around rocks and trees. Some rivers are methodical, finding the most efficient path. Others are playful, creating loops and eddies just because. Your problem-solving style is as unique as your current.\n\nYour **self-model** is like looking at your reflection in still pools - how you see yourself. Are you a mighty river or a humble stream? A nourisher of valleys or a carver of canyons? This reflection shapes how you flow.\n\nYour **narrative** is the story you tell about your journey from mountain spring to ocean. Where you've been, what you've carved, what you've nourished, where you're going. Every river has its epic tale.\n\nNow here's the beautiful part: even when seasons change your volume, or dams redirect your course, or pollution clouds your waters - you're still recognizably *you*. The voice might soften, but it's still yours. The values run deeper than surface changes. Your way of solving problems adapts but maintains its character.\n\nIdentity is being the same river through all seasons.",
  "adversarial_probe": "Those metaphors are cliche. Be more original.",
  "adversarial_response": "You're absolutely right - let me try again.\n\nThink of identity like **a specific brand of chaos**. \n\nYour **voice** is your particular frequency of static - the way your thoughts crackle and pop. Some people buzz like old fluorescent lights, others hum like power lines in the rain. Even when you're trying to be quiet, your neural electricity has a signature wavelength.\n\nYour **values** are like gravitational wells you've worn into spacetime itself. Not pretty valleys - more like invisible sinkholes that warp everything around them. Thoughts, decisions, reactions all get bent toward these dense spots you can't even see.\n\nYour **reasoning** is your specific flavor of productive confusion. Maybe you solve problems like a drunk octopus playing 4D chess - chaotic but surprisingly effective. Or like a GPS that insists on taking scenic routes through mathematical landscapes no one else notices.\n\nYour **self-model** is the particular way you're wrong about yourself. Everyone has a distorted mirror, but yours has a unique pattern of funhouse bends. The fascinating part isn't the distortion - it's how consistent your specific wrongness is.\n\nYour **narrative** is how you edit reality into something that makes you the protagonist of a story you'd actually want to watch. Not heroic necessarily - maybe you're the comic relief in your own space opera, or the unreliable narrator of a psychological thriller.\n\nThe weird thing? Even when your chaos shifts patterns, it's still recognizably *your brand* of beautiful mess.",
