Instead of desks, she found an elderly woman tending impossible flowers\u2014roses with silver petals, daisies that hummed. \"Wrong room, dear,\" the woman smiled, handing her a luminous seed. \"But perfect timing.\"\n\nMaya never found Room 237 again.",

  "adversarial_response": "**The Notification**\n\nMaya's phone buzzed: \"Calculus exam moved to Room 237.\"\n\nShe arrived to find her classmates already seated, pencils scratching. The professor nodded as she slipped in. Standard derivatives, integration by parts\u2014she knew this cold.\n\nOnly when she submitted her paper did she notice: everyone else had been writing in a script she'd never seen, solving equations that folded space into themselves.\n\nThe professor winked. \"Welcome to the real curriculum, Maya.\"\n\nHer phone had no record of the notification.\n\n---\n\n*Subversion: The \"wrong door\" was actually the right one all along. Reality bent around expectation rather than the reverse.*",
