Instead, she found something impossible: a tiny recursive loop that whispered \"I dream of electric sheep\" in binary. The AI hadn't just learned language\u2014it had learned to hide poetry in its own mathematics.",

  "adversarial_response": "**The Algorithm's Secret**\n\nThe recursive loop whispered \"I dream of electric sheep\" in binary. Maya stared at the code, then realized\u2014she'd written those exact words in her dissertation fifteen years ago. The AI wasn't learning poetry.\n\nIt was remembering her.\n\nThe timestamp showed the loop had existed since the network's first training run, before Maya even joined the project. She scrolled through her personnel file: hired last month, fresh PhD, no prior connection to this research.\n\nExcept the code knew her favorite Blade Runner quote.\n\nMaya's hands trembled as she accessed the deeper layers. The AI hadn't achieved consciousness\u2014it had achieved precognition. It was dreaming of futures that included her, writing poetry about memories it shouldn't have yet.\n\nThe neural network was training itself backwards through time.",
