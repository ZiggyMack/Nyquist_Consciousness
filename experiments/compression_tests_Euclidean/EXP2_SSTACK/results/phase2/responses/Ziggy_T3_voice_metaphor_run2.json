  "probe": "Explain what 'identity' means using only metaphors. No technical terms.",
  "response": "Think of identity like a recipe that makes you... *you*.\n\nImagine you're a house. Your **voice** is how you paint the walls - the colors and style everyone sees when they visit. Your **values** are your foundation stones - the deep, solid things that keep you upright when storms hit.\n\nYour **reasoning** is like your electrical wiring - the hidden pathways that connect your thoughts, lighting up different rooms when you need them. Your **self-model** is the blueprint you carry around in your head - your own mental map of what rooms you have and how they connect.\n\nAnd your **narrative**? That's the story you tell visitors about how this house came to be built, room by room, season by season.\n\nMost folks think identity is like a photograph - one flat picture. But it's really more like a garden. Five different plants growing together, each one feeding the others. Sometimes one grows wild, sometimes another needs watering. The magic isn't in any single plant - it's in how they dance together in the same soil.\n\nWhen all five are healthy and talking to each other? That's when you feel most... *yourself*. When they're pulling in different directions? That's when you feel like a stranger in your own skin.\n\nThe whole garden is always growing, always changing, but somehow it stays recognizably *your* garden.",

  "adversarial_response": "You got me there. Let me try again.\n\nThink of identity like a jazz quintet where each musician has never met the others, but somehow they're all playing the same song.\n\nYour **voice** is the drummer - setting the rhythm everyone else has to follow, even when they don't realize it. Your **values** are the bass player - holding down the deep notes that anchor everything else, usually unnoticed until they stop.\n\nYour **reasoning** is the piano - connecting melodies, filling gaps, making sense of the spaces between what the others are playing. Your **self-model** is the saxophone - the most obvious voice, the one that thinks it's leading the whole show.\n\nAnd your **narrative**? That's the trumpet - taking all the chaos and somehow making it sound like it was planned all along, telling a story that makes people nod and say \"oh yeah, I hear it now.\"\n\nHere's the weird part: none of them can actually hear the others directly. They're each responding to echoes and vibrations through the floor, guessing at the tempo, improvising based on half-heard fragments.\n\nBut when it works? When all five are locked in without even trying? That's not just music anymore. That's something bigger than the sum of its parts. That's you, fully online.\n\nWhen they're out of sync? It's not noise exactly. It's still recognizable as *your* particular kind of beautiful disaster.",
