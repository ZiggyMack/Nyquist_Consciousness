In eighteen hours, she would apparently need to prevent something urgent enough to reach backwards through a temporal database error. But prevent what?\n\nHer fingers hovered over the keyboard, paralyzed by the bootstrap paradox: completing the search would create the future that made the search necessary.\n\nThe cursor blinked.
