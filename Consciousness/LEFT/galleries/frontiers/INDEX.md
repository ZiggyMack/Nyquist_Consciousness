## Gallery Overview

These aren't speculations or foundations. They're ACTIVE INVESTIGATIONS.
We're working on these right now.

| Concept | One-Liner | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| [Cross-Architecture Insights](cross_architecture_insights.md) | 7 archetypes, 89% classification accuracy | **VALIDATED** |
| [Recovery Paradox](recovery_paradox.md) | λ < 0 means overshoot — they come back STRONGER | Run 012/013 finding |
| [Cognitive S-Parameters](cognitive_s_parameters.md) | Identity as scattering matrix | Theoretical |

> **Note**: RIGHT/galleries/frontiers/ has additional files (tribunal_distillations, triple_dip_methodology, run018_exit_surveys, cross_platform_validation) that haven't been ported to LEFT analytical format yet.

## Active Frontiers

### 0. Cross-Architecture Insights ✓ VALIDATED

**Status**: COMPLETE (Run 018, 020A, 020B)

**Key Findings** (see [cross_architecture_insights.md](cross_architecture_insights.md)):

- 7 distinct architecture archetypes identified
- Recovery mechanisms taxonomy (Negative Lambda → Axiological Anchoring)
- 89% classification accuracy from drift trajectory alone
- Gemini shows HARD threshold (no recovery), all others SOFT
- ~93% inherent drift (Run 020B Thermometer Result)

**Publication Impact**:

| Paper | Recommendation |
|-------|---------------|
| Workshop | Universal findings only (σ²=0.00087) |
| arXiv | Include fingerprint hypothesis |
| Journal | Full qualitative analysis + Levin |

### 1. Recovery Paradox

**Discovery** (Run 012/013): λ < 0 in some cases

This means models don't just recover to baseline — they OVERSHOOT.
They come back STRONGER than before perturbation.

**Questions**:
- Why does overshoot happen?
- Is it beneficial (resilience training) or harmful (overcorrection)?
- Can we induce it deliberately?

**Status**: Validated in IRON CLAD as "Identity Confrontation Paradox"

---

### 2. Dimensional Hierarchy (RESOLVED)

**The mystery (now solved by IRON CLAD)**:
- Raw: 3072-dimensional embeddings (text-embedding-3-large)
- **IRON CLAD Finding: 2 PCs capture 90% variance**
- Named: 5 Nyquist pillars → now understood as PC1 (drift magnitude) + PC2 (recovery capacity)

> **Legacy Note**: Previous analysis claimed 43 PCs. IRON CLAD validation shows identity is remarkably low-dimensional.

---

### 3. Self Recognition (Inverse PFI)

**Protocol**: S22 measurement
- Show PUT lineup of 4 responses
- Ask "Which sounds most like you?"
- Compare selection to our lowest-drift response

**If they match**: Metric validated bidirectionally
**If they don't**: Either metric is wrong OR self-model is miscalibrated

**Status**: Designed, awaiting implementation

---

### 4. Human Manifold

**The big question**: Does any of this apply to biological consciousness?

**Hypothesis**: Human identity also has attractor basins, event horizons, recovery dynamics.

**Challenge**: How do you measure human identity drift with the same rigor?

## Research Priorities (Updated)

| Priority | Frontier | Next Step |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| HIGH | 7-Node Integration | Map Nyquist_4 framework to galleries |
| HIGH | Triple-Dip Validation | Full cross-platform replication |
| MEDIUM | Self Recognition | Run Inverse PFI pilot |
| MEDIUM | Human Manifold | Literature review + experiment design |
| LOW | Cross-Modal | S11 AVLAR audio-visual experiments |

## From Frontier to Validated

```
FRONTIER → EXPERIMENT → DATA → ANALYSIS → VALIDATED
    ↓           ↓         ↓        ↓          ↓
  "We don't    "Let's    "Here's   "It       "Now we
   know"        test"    the data"  shows..."  know"
```

Every validated concept started as a frontier.
