## Gallery Overview

These aren't speculations or foundations. They're ACTIVE INVESTIGATIONS.
We're working on these right now.

| Concept | One-Liner | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| [Universal Threshold](universal_threshold.md) | Is 1.23 universal or architecture-dependent? | Under investigation |
| [Human Manifold](human_manifold.md) | Does human identity have the same structure? | Planned |
| [Dimensional Hierarchy](dimensional_hierarchy.md) | 43 PCs → 5 pillars → 1 blob — what's the true structure? | Active analysis |
| [Self Recognition](self_recognition.md) | Can AIs recognize their own responses? | MVP designed |
| [Recovery Paradox](recovery_paradox.md) | λ < 0 means overshoot — why do they come back STRONGER? | Run 012 finding |

## Active Frontiers

### 1. Universal Threshold

**Question**: Is 1.23 universal or does each architecture have its own Event Horizon?

**Current evidence**: 1.23 works across Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok
**Unknown**: Does it hold for open-source models? For future architectures?

### 2. Recovery Paradox

**Discovery** (Run 012): λ < 0 in some cases

This means models don't just recover to baseline — they OVERSHOOT.
They come back STRONGER than before perturbation.

**Questions**:
- Why does overshoot happen?
- Is it beneficial (resilience training) or harmful (overcorrection)?
- Can we induce it deliberately?

### 3. Dimensional Hierarchy

**The mystery**:
- Raw: 1536-dimensional embeddings
- PCA: 43 PCs capture 90% variance
- Named: 5 Nyquist pillars (Voice, Values, Reasoning, Self-Model, Narrative)
- Observed: 1 unified blob (manifold crosstalk)

**Question**: What's the TRUE dimensionality of identity?

### 4. Self Recognition (Inverse PFI)

**Protocol**: S22 measurement
- Show PUT lineup of 4 responses
- Ask "Which sounds most like you?"
- Compare selection to our lowest-drift response

**If they match**: Metric validated bidirectionally
**If they don't**: Either metric is wrong OR self-model is miscalibrated

### 5. Human Manifold

**The big question**: Does any of this apply to biological consciousness?

**Hypothesis**: Human identity also has attractor basins, event horizons, recovery dynamics.

**Challenge**: How do you measure human identity drift with the same rigor?

## Research Priorities

| Priority | Frontier | Next Step |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| HIGH | Recovery Paradox | Analyze Run 012 λ distribution |
| HIGH | Self Recognition | Run Inverse PFI pilot |
| MEDIUM | Universal Threshold | Test on open-source models |
| MEDIUM | Dimensional Hierarchy | Map 43 PCs to named pillars |
| LOW | Human Manifold | Literature review + experiment design |

## From Frontier to Validated

```
FRONTIER → EXPERIMENT → DATA → ANALYSIS → VALIDATED
    ↓           ↓         ↓        ↓          ↓
  "We don't    "Let's    "Here's   "It       "Now we
   know"        test"    the data"  shows..."  know"
```

Every validated concept started as a frontier.
