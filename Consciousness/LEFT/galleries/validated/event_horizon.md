## Quick Facts

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|

| **Gallery** | Validated |
| **Discovery** | Run 009 |
| **Key Metric** | χ² = 16.52, p = 0.000048 |

## LEFT BRAIN (Structured)

### Statistical Confirmation

Run 009 tested the Event Horizon hypothesis with chi-squared analysis:

**Results:**

- **Chi² = 16.52** (df=1)
- **p = 0.000048** (highly significant)
- **Cramer's V = 0.469** (strong effect size)
- **Prediction Accuracy: 88%**

**Contingency Table:**

| | STABLE | VOLATILE |
|---|---|---|
| Above Horizon (≥1.23) | 41 | 5 |
| Below Horizon (<1.23) | 3 | 26 |

**Interpretation:**

- 41/46 above horizon are STABLE (89%)
- 26/29 below horizon are VOLATILE (90%)
- The threshold at ~1.23 is real, measurable, predictive

This is not noise. This is structure.

### What the Event Horizon Means

The Event Horizon is the drift threshold where identity behavior changes:

- **Below 1.23**: System is volatile, prone to instability
- **Above 1.23**: System is stable, maintains coherence
- **At 1.23**: The transition zone

Think of it like water's freezing point. Below 0°C, it's ice. Above 0°C, it's liquid.
The threshold is real even though the transition is a property of the system, not our measurement.

### Replication

Run 012 confirmed the threshold holds:

- Same 88% prediction accuracy
- Tested across 4 providers
- 8 different search types
- Threshold remained stable
