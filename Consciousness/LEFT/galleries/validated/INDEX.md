# Validated Gallery

**Empirically confirmed through experimentation.**

## Gallery Overview

These concepts have moved beyond hypothesis. They have data. They have statistics.
They are the foundation we build upon.

| Concept | One-Liner | Evidence |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| [Event Horizon](event_horizon.md) | The threshold at 0.80 (cosine) is REAL | p = 2.40e-23 (IRON CLAD) |
| [Identity Confrontation Paradox](identity_confrontation_paradox.md) | Challenge stabilizes, doesn't destabilize | Run 013 boundary mapping |

> **Note**: Additional validated concepts (Echo's Critique, PFI Validation, Unified Manifold) were documented in legacy INDEX but files were never created. These findings are now subsumed under IRON CLAD methodology.

## What "Validated" Means

A concept moves to Validated when:

1. **Statistical significance**: p < 0.05 (we aim for p < 0.01)
2. **Effect size**: Meaningful magnitude (not just statistically significant)
3. **Reproducibility**: Confirmed across multiple runs or providers
4. **Prediction**: The concept predicts future observations

## IRON CLAD Validation (Canonical - Run 023)

| Metric | Value | What It Shows |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Event Horizon | **0.80** (cosine) | Identity boundary threshold |
| p-value | **2.40e-23** | Highly significant |
| Dimensionality | **2 PCs** | Capture 90% of variance |
| Inherent Drift | **~93%** | Most drift is inherent to interaction |
| Cohen's d | 0.698 | Model-level effect size |
| Total experiments | 4505 | Run 023 foundation |

> **Legacy Note**: Pre-IRON CLAD used EH=1.23 (keyword RMS) and 43 PCs. These have been superseded.

## The Journey to Validation

```
SPECULATIVE → FOUNDATIONS → VALIDATED
     ↓              ↓            ↓
  "What if?"    "Let's test"   "It's real"
```

Every validated concept started as speculation. The difference is data.
