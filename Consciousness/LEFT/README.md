## What Lives Here

The LEFT hemisphere contains:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `galleries/` | Concept files with structured presentation |
| `extractions/` | Tagged, categorized data from experiments |
| `data/` | Processed, normalized datasets |
| `visualizations/` | Charts, graphs, statistical plots |

## The LEFT Brain Approach

When processing consciousness research through the LEFT hemisphere:

1. **Define** - Clear terminology, precise definitions
2. **Measure** - Quantitative metrics, statistical tests
3. **Categorize** - Organize into taxonomies
4. **Prove** - Hypothesis testing, p-values, effect sizes
5. **Document** - Tables, structured markdown, citations

## Gallery Structure

```
LEFT/galleries/
├── validated/       # Empirically confirmed (with statistics)
├── foundations/     # Core theory (with formal definitions)
├── speculative/     # Hypotheses (with testable predictions)
└── frontiers/       # Active research (with methodology)
```

Each concept file emphasizes:
- Tables and structured data
- Statistical evidence
- Logical progression
- Academic rigor

---

## Tools (via BRIDGE)

The LEFT hemisphere uses analytical tools from `BRIDGE/scripts/left/`:

- `run_extraction.py` - Extract and categorize data
- `compute_statistics.py` - Statistical analysis
- `validate_hypothesis.py` - Formal hypothesis testing

---

## Connection to RIGHT

The LEFT hemisphere analyzes what the RIGHT hemisphere intuits.

```
RIGHT (intuition) → BRIDGE (integration) → LEFT (verification)
LEFT (evidence) → BRIDGE (integration) → RIGHT (synthesis)
```

Neither hemisphere is complete without the other.
