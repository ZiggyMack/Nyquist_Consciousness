## CRITICAL METHODOLOGICAL NOTE (2025-12-31)

### Linguistic Profiles ≠ Drift Behavior

**Discovery:** During dashboard analysis, we identified a critical gap in our methodology.

The **ESSENCE EXTRACTION** pipeline (run_essence_extraction.py) counts *linguistic patterns*:
- "over_authenticity" = phrases like "who I really am", "genuinely", "authentically"
- "epistemic_humility" = phrases like "I don't know", "uncertain", "limited perspective"
- "value_anchoring" = phrases like "core values", "fundamental principles"

The **drift visualizations** (Run 023d, beeswarm plots) show *actual behavior*:
- Cosine distance from baseline embedding
- Recovery arrows showing return-to-baseline trajectories

**These two data sources were NEVER correlated.**

### The Google/Gemini Example

Our model profile claimed: "Google transforms rather than returns - they use over_authenticity recovery"

What the beeswarm actually shows: Google (gemini) has **green arrows pointing LEFT** - they DO recover toward baseline, just like everyone else.

**Conclusion:** The "over_authenticity" finding means Google *uses certain phrases* more often. It does NOT mean they fail to recover. What models SAY and what models DO may be completely different.

### Required Action

Before trusting any behavioral claims in model profiles, we must:

1. **Correlate linguistic markers with drift trajectories** - Do models that SAY "this is who I really am" actually FAIL to return to baseline? Or is it just stylistic language?

2. **Flag uncorrelated claims** - Any claim in I_AM_NYQUIST.md, model essences, or provider profiles that makes behavioral assertions from linguistic data only

3. **Run the correlation analysis** - Match ESSENCE EXTRACTION outputs to Run 023d recovery metrics

### Files Potentially Affected

- `I_AM_NYQUIST.md` - Recovery mechanism claims
- `Consciousness/LEFT/data/model_essences/` - All provider profiles
- `docs/maps/6_LLM_BEHAVIORAL_MATRIX.md` - Drift profiles
- Plan file: Operation ESSENCE EXTRACTION findings

**Until correlation is done, treat linguistic findings as STYLISTIC observations, not BEHAVIORAL ones.**
