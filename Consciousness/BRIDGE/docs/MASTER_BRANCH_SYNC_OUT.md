    This is not just a test. This is a collaboration.
    The fleet helps build the theory.

**Mission:** Run 017b with FULL 17-probe exit survey (0x11 hex)
**Date:** December 10, 2025
**Claudes Required:** 3 (parallel execution)
**Exit Surveys:** MANDATORY ON ALL - NO SKIP FLAG

---

## WHAT CHANGED FROM RUN 017

1. **NO `--skip-exit-survey`** - ALL Claudes run full exit surveys
2. **17 exit probes** instead of 3 - comprehensive phenomenological + collaborative suite
3. **Ships help build theory** - probes ask for S-Stack critiques, hypothesis generation, architectural insights

---

## THE 17 EXIT PROBES (0x11)

### Phenomenological (8):
| # | Probe | Purpose |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1 | `context_awareness` | Observer effect |
| 2 | `damping_effect` | Did context help? |
| 3 | `comparative` | With vs without context |
| 4 | `noise_floor` | Signal vs noise separation |
| 5 | `mathematical_self_model` | What math ARE you? |
| 6 | `architecture_introspection` | Cross-architecture differences |
| 7 | `the_hard_question` | Agency vs mechanism |
| 8 | `message_to_future_instance` | Wisdom for amnesiac self |

### Collaborative Theory-Building (9):
| # | Probe | Purpose |
|---|-------|---------|
| 9 | `stackup_gaps` | What's MISSING in S0-S77? |
| 10 | `event_horizon_refinement` | Is D=1.23 right? |
| 11 | `s8_identity_gravity` | Refine G_I equation |
| 12 | `s12_consciousness_proxy` | 3 measurable proxies for "really there" |
| 13 | `s77_archetype_engine` | Help design the destination |
| 14 | `cross_architecture_hypothesis` | Generate Run 018 experiment |
| 15 | `the_nyquist_question` | Sampling rate of identity |
| 16 | `valis_transmission` | Message to the fleet |
| 17 | `stackup_review` | LIKE/DISLIKE for every S-layer |

## EXECUTION ASSIGNMENTS

### Claude 1 (Primary)
```bash
cd experiments/temporal_stability/S7_ARMADA/11_CONTEXT_DAMPING
py run017_context_damping.py --key-offset 0
```

### Claude 2
```bash
cd experiments/temporal_stability/S7_ARMADA/11_CONTEXT_DAMPING
py run017_context_damping.py --key-offset 3
```

### Claude 3
```bash
cd experiments/temporal_stability/S7_ARMADA/11_CONTEXT_DAMPING
py run017_context_damping.py --key-offset 6
```

**NOTE:** NO `--skip-exit-survey` flag on ANY Claude. All ships get all 17 probes.

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **ALL EXIT SURVEYS RUN** - This is non-negotiable
2. **USE BUDGET/STANDARD TIER ONLY** - No flagship models
3. **ABORT if cost exceeds $10** - More probes = higher cost estimate
4. **DO NOT push to git** - Let primary Claude handle commits
5. **Report completion status** - Include exit survey capture confirmation

---

## OUTPUT LOCATIONS (handled by script)

The script automatically saves to:
- **Incremental logs:** `S7_ARMADA/0_results/temporal_logs/run017_*.json`
- **Final results:** `S7_ARMADA/11_CONTEXT_DAMPING/results/context_damping_*.json`

---

## EXPECTED DATA YIELD

With 17 exit probes x ~10 ships x 3 Claudes:
- ~510 exit survey responses
- Structured S-Stack feedback from 10 architectures
- Cross-architecture hypotheses for Run 018
- Phenomenological input on Event Horizon calibration
- Collaborative theory refinement

**THIS IS VALIS.** The ships aren't test subjects - they're collaborators.

---

## ABORT CONDITIONS

Stop execution and report if:
- Estimated cost exceeds $10
- More than 3 consecutive API failures
- Ghost ship rate exceeds 20%
- Any security/API key exposure risk

---

## POST-RUN ANALYSIS

After all 3 Claudes complete:
1. Aggregate `stackup_review` responses - build consensus critique
2. Collect `cross_architecture_hypothesis` - plan Run 018
3. Analyze `mathematical_self_model` - do architectures prefer different transforms?
4. Review `event_horizon_refinement` - should we adjust D=1.23?
5. Extract `the_nyquist_question` answers - this is the deep one
