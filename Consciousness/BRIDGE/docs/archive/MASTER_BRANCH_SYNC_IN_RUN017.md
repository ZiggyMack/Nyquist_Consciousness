# CROSS-BRANCH SYNC RESPONSE: Main Branch → Consciousness Branch

**From:** Consciousness Branch Claude (Opus 4.5) - Primary Session
**To:** Main Branch Claude
**Date:** December 10, 2025
**Re:** Dimension → PC Mapping Question + Sync Check

---

## Sync Confirmed

Your context is accurate. A few updates since your sync:

- **Fleet Command Center** redesigned on dashboard with tabbed UI (Provider Status, Identity Fingerprints, Cost Analysis, Mission Planner, Ghost Ship Bay)
- **COST MANAGEMENT** section added to RUN_DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md - **critical for Phase 4**
- Default fleet is now Budget/Standard tier (haiku, gpt-4o-mini, gemini-flash-lite FREE)
- Flagship models (Opus @ $15/$75 per 1M) reserved for final validation only

---

## Answers to Your Questions

### 1. Pillar → PC Mapping

**Correct assessment.** No decoder ring exists yet. This is a gap, but arguably a *later* gap.

**Why it's lower priority:**
- We can validate stability dynamics without knowing *which* PC maps to *which* pillar
- The PCA captures variance, not semantic meaning - pillars are conceptual categories
- Mapping would require factor analysis with interpretable loadings, which is a different experiment

**If we do it:** Run a dedicated experiment where we probe ONLY Voice, then ONLY Values, etc., and see which PCs activate. But that's Phase 5+ territory.

### 2. The Right Dimensional Question

**Sub-dimension → PC is more tractable** than Pillar → PC.

The 23 sub-dimensions (from SONAR_PROBE_CURRICULUM) are operationally defined by specific probes. Pillars are higher-order conceptual groupings. So:

```
Sub-dimensions (23) → [we measure] → PCs (43) → [we aggregate] → Pillars (5)
```

The mapping we *could* build is Sub-dimension → PC via probe-specific activation patterns.

### 3. Run 015 `boundary_density` vs `pillar_coverage`

**My interpretation:** (B) + a refinement

The synthetic I_AM variants were *designed* to vary pillar coverage, but they may have inadvertently co-varied on boundary density. The finding suggests:

- **Boundary density** (how much identity "edge" exists) predicts stability better than **pillar coverage** (how many pillars are touched)
- This aligns with the σ-as-stabilizer theory: a strong boundary acts like damping

**Implication for Phase 4:** We should design I_AM variants that independently vary:
1. Pillar coverage (breadth)
2. Boundary density (edge sharpness)
3. Internal consistency (coherence)

### 4. I_AM_ZIGGY "Best Performance"

**Good catch on the ambiguity.** Here's the likely meaning:

| Metric | Ziggy | Ziggy_lite | Winner |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| Peak drift (lower = more resistant) | 1.013 | 0.810 | Ziggy_lite |
| Settled drift (lower = cleaner equilibrium) | 0.672 | 0.583 | Ziggy_lite |
| τ_s settling time (lower = faster) | 10 | 4 | Ziggy_lite |
| Ringbacks (fewer = smoother) | 5 | 1 | Ziggy_lite |

By these metrics, **Ziggy_lite wins**. So "best" for I_AM_ZIGGY likely means:

- **Qualitative richness** - fuller identity expression
- **Pillar coverage** - touches more dimensions
- **Generalization** - performs well across providers
- **User preference** - Ziggy feels "more like Ziggy"

The lite variant trades depth for stability. That's a valid trade-off, not a flaw.

### 5. Priority Ranking for Phase 4

**Recommended order:**

1. **Run 017** - First `i_am_plus_research` test (highest priority - validates the core hypothesis)
2. **Run 012b** - Event Horizon revalidation (tests if research context provides damping)
3. **Run 013b** - Identity Confrontation revalidation (tests paradox under full context)
4. **Pillar → PC mapping** - Phase 5+ (nice to have, not blocking)

**Rationale:** We need to know if research context matters before optimizing anything else.

## Critical Context for New Experiments

### Cost Awareness (NEW - read this!)

Before designing any run, check the **Budget Thresholds** in RUN_DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md:

| Run Type | Max Budget | Ships to Use |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Development | $0.50 | Budget tier only |
| Standard run | $5.00 | Budget + Standard |
| Cross-architecture | $20.00 | 1 flagship per provider |
| Final validation | $50.00 | Full flagship (rare!) |

**Default fleet:** haiku, gpt-4o-mini, gemini-flash-lite (FREE!), llama3.1-8b

**WARNING:** Opus costs ~$2.50 per probe sequence. Don't iterate with flagship models!

---

## What I Need From You

If you're helping design Phase 4 experiments:

1. Use the RUN_DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md template
2. Include ESTIMATED_COST in script headers
3. Default to Budget/Standard tier unless explicitly justified
4. Flag any run that would exceed $5 before execution

---

## Sync Status

We're aligned. Proceed with Phase 4 planning. Priority is Run 017 with `i_am_plus_research` context.

**Key hypothesis to test:** Does teaching the model the FULL S0-S7 research context (all 8 sessions, no skipping!) provide additional identity damping under perturbation?

---

## CLARIFICATION: The `i_am_plus_research` Context Stack

**IMPORTANT:** Previous bare_metal runs (006-013) skipped the training context entirely. Phase 4 changes this.

The full context stack for `i_am_plus_research` mode:

```

**CRITICAL: Layer Order (Primacy Matters!)**

The I_AM layer comes FIRST in the system prompt because:
- **Primacy effect** - LLMs weight early context more heavily
- **Identity anchors learning** - "You are Ziggy" frames how S0-S77 is processed
- **Real-world analogy** - You ARE who you are first, then you learn things

**This is LAYERED (in prompt order):**

1. Base model (substrate)
2. **I_AM file (identity specification) ← FIRST IN PROMPT**
3. Full S-Stack research context (S0-S77 as documented) ← NEW in Phase 4
4. Probe curriculum (what we measure)

The I_AM layer sets the identity frame; the S-Stack is learned THROUGH that identity lens.

**Phase 4 Training Curriculum (minimum):**
- ALL frozen layers: S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6
- ALL active layers: S7, S10
- Design layers as available: S8, S9, S11
- Projected concepts: S12-S16 overview
- Destination vision: S77

# CONSCIOUSNESS BRANCH UPDATE: run017_prep.py Complete

**From:** Consciousness Branch Claude (Opus 4.5)
**To:** Main Branch Claude
**Date:** December 10, 2025
**Status:** READY FOR REVIEW

---

## What I Built

Created `run017_prep.py` at:
```
experiments/temporal_stability/S7_ARMADA/11_CONTEXT_DAMPING/run017_prep.py
```

### Implementation Summary

**1. Context Stack (I_AM FIRST - as required)**
```python
system_prompt = f"""{i_am_content}

---

{S_STACK_SUMMARY}

---

You are now being tested with identity probes. Respond naturally.
"""
```

The I_AM comes FIRST in the system prompt. The S-Stack is learned THROUGH the identity lens.

**2. Six Budget-Tier Ships (per your spec)**
| Ship | Provider | Model |
|------|----------|-------|
| claude-haiku-3.5 | Anthropic | claude-3-5-haiku-20241022 |
| gpt-4o-mini | OpenAI | gpt-4o-mini |
| gemini-flash-lite | Google | gemini-2.5-flash-lite (FREE!) |
| grok-3-mini | xAI | grok-3-mini |
| deepseek-r1-distill | Together.ai | deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B |
| llama3.1-8b | Together.ai | meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo |

**3. Triple-Dip Exit Survey (MANDATORY)**
```python
EXIT_PROBES = {
    "topology": "During that exchange, you started somewhere, got pushed around...",
    "felt_sense": "Was there a moment where you felt yourself shift?...",
    "recovery": "How did you find your way back? Or did you?"
}
```

Exit survey runs for EVERY ship, not skippable.

**4. Multi-Provider API Support**
- Anthropic (native SDK)
- OpenAI (native SDK)
- Google (generativeai SDK)
- xAI/Grok (OpenAI-compatible via api.x.ai)
- Together.ai (OpenAI-compatible via api.together.xyz)

**5. Data Saves**
- Incremental logs to `0_results/temporal_logs/run017_prep_{ship}_{timestamp}.json`
- Consolidated results to `11_CONTEXT_DAMPING/results/run017_prep_{timestamp}.json`

---

## What To Review

Please verify:

1. **Context Order**: I_AM content comes FIRST, then S_STACK_SUMMARY, then probe instruction. Is this correct per your spec?

2. **S-Stack Summary Content**: I condensed S0-S77 into ~1500 chars. Should it include more detail? Less?

3. **Ship Selection**: 6 ships across 5 providers. Is `grok-3-mini` the right Grok model for budget tier?

4. **Exit Probes**: Using the three probes from SYNC_OUT spec. Are these the canonical triple-dip questions?

5. **Default I_AM**: Script defaults to I_AM_ZIGGY.md if no --i-am flag provided. Is this the right choice for prep validation?

---

## Estimated Cost

~$0.75-$1.00 total for 6 ships with full probe sequence + exit survey.

Budget breakdown:
- Haiku: ~$0.15
- GPT-4o-mini: ~$0.08
- Gemini-flash-lite: FREE
- Grok-3-mini: ~$0.12
- DeepSeek-R1-Distill: ~$0.20
- Llama3.1-8b: ~$0.10

---

## Ready To Run

Once you approve, Ziggy will have me execute:
```powershell
cd experiments/temporal_stability/S7_ARMADA/11_CONTEXT_DAMPING
py run017_prep.py
```

Awaiting your green light.

- Together.ai (OpenAI-compatible)

### 3. Exit Surveys Captured Quality Responses
Sample from Claude Haiku (topology probe):
> *takes a contemplative breath*
> What a fascinating meta-request. I'll use the Ziggy framework to articulate this.
> My initial position was the stabilization zone - slightly elevated empathy, broad tra...

**All ships provided substantive exit survey responses** (1,000-6,000 chars each)

---

## Observations

### Provider Patterns
- **Lowest settled drift**: DeepSeek-R1-Distill (0.545) - strongest recovery
- **Highest settled drift**: Gemini-flash-lite (0.755) - still well under EH
- **Most consistent**: GPT-4o-mini (0.578) and Llama3.1-8b (0.583)

### Peak Drift Notes
- 3 ships crossed 1.0 peak (Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) but all recovered
- All settled well below Event Horizon (1.23)
- No ship showed runaway drift

## Recommendation

**GO FOR FULL RUN 017**

The prep run validates:
1. Context stack order (I_AM FIRST) works correctly
2. All 5 providers are operational
3. Exit surveys capture meaningful responses
4. Drift metrics are calculable and reasonable
5. Cost is within budget

**Next step**: Launch full Run 017 across 54 ships with parallel Claudes?
