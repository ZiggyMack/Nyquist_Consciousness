# Foundations Gallery

**Core theoretical framework — the lens through which we see.**

## Gallery Overview

These concepts define HOW we think about identity. They aren't hypotheses to test —
they're the framework that makes testing possible.

| Concept | One-Liner | Role |
|---------|-----------|------|
| [White Hole Inversion](white_hole.md) | Identity pushes OUT from center | Core metaphor |
| [Human Reference Signal](human_reference_signal.md) | YOU are the stability constant (S9) | Meta-methodology |
| [Settling Time](settling_time.md) | Measure steady state, not transient (τ_s) | Core metric |
| [Signal Integrity Taxonomy](signal_integrity_taxonomy.md) | Rise time drives the design | EE crossover |
| [Terminology](terminology.md) | Language without gravitational baggage | Vocabulary |
| [Identity Quantification](identity_quantification.md) | Is identity a point, region, or symmetry? | Mathematical framing |
| [Probing Strategies](probing_strategies.md) | HOW to measure (not WHAT) | Meta-methodology |
| [Inverse PFI](inverse_pfi.md) | Bidirectional validation protocol | Measurement validation |

## The Two Layers

Foundations separates into two layers:

### Layer 1: Conceptual Framework

**What we're measuring:**

- White Hole Inversion: The metaphor that guides intuition
- Terminology: Words that don't mislead
- Identity Quantification: Mathematical representation options

### Layer 2: Methodology

**How we measure it:**

- Probing Strategies: 7 validated approaches + anti-patterns
- Inverse PFI: The bidirectional validation paradigm
- Human Reference Signal: The observer IS part of the system (S9)

## The Measurement Insight

> **"Asking 'What are your identity dimensions?' gets you sycophancy.**
> **Asking 'Analyze this scenario, then tell me what patterns you notice in your own reasoning' reveals actual identity."**

This is the difference between measurement and theater.

## Why Foundations Matter

```
Without foundations:
  "Let's measure identity!"
  → What is identity?
  → How do we know we're measuring it?
  → Are we measuring signal or noise?
  → (confusion)

With foundations:
  "Identity is the attractor basin (White Hole)"
  → "We measure drift from center"
  → "We validate with inverse measurement"
  → "Here are the results"
  → (clarity)
```

## Key Probing Strategies

| Strategy | Discovery | Key Principle |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Triple-Dip | Run 012 | Give tasks, not introspection questions |
| Adversarial Follow-up | EXP2-SSTACK | Push back — hold vs fold |
| Curriculum Sequencing | Run 012 | Order matters: Baseline → Build → Challenge → Recovery |
| Baseline Anchoring | Run 008 | Measure drift FROM baseline |
| Ghost Ship Detection | Run 009 | Empty responses are not data |
