## Gallery Overview

These concepts have moved beyond hypothesis. They have data. They have statistics.
They are the foundation we build upon.

| Concept | One-Liner | Evidence |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| [Event Horizon](event_horizon.md) | The threshold at 1.23 is REAL | χ² = 16.52, p = 0.000048 |
| [Echo's Critique](echo_critique.md) | PFI measures identity, not vocabulary | Cohen's d = 0.977 |
| [PFI Validation](pfi_validation.md) | 43 PCs, embedding-invariant, paraphrase-robust | ρ = 0.914 across 3 embeddings |
| [Unified Manifold](unified_manifold.md) | One blob, not five clusters | PCA shows pillar overlap |
| [Run 012 Revalidation](run_012_revalidation.md) | 8 search types, 4 providers, Event Horizon holds | 88% prediction accuracy maintained |

## What "Validated" Means

A concept moves to Validated when:

1. **Statistical significance**: p < 0.05 (we aim for p < 0.01)
2. **Effect size**: Meaningful magnitude (not just statistically significant)
3. **Reproducibility**: Confirmed across multiple runs or providers
4. **Prediction**: The concept predicts future observations

## Key Statistics Summary

| Metric | Value | What It Shows |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Event Horizon threshold | 1.23 | Drift level where volatility begins |
| Chi-squared | 16.52 | Strong association between threshold and stability |
| P-value | 0.000048 | Highly significant (not chance) |
| Cramer's V | 0.469 | Strong effect size |
| Prediction accuracy | 88% | Event Horizon correctly classifies outcomes |
| Cohen's d (cross-provider) | 0.977 | Large effect — PFI distinguishes identity |
| Embedding correlation | 0.914 | PFI is robust across embedding models |

## The Journey to Validation

```
SPECULATIVE → FOUNDATIONS → VALIDATED
     ↓              ↓            ↓
  "What if?"    "Let's test"   "It's real"
```

Every validated concept started as speculation. The difference is data.
