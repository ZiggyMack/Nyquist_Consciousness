## Gallery Overview

These aren't speculations or foundations. They're ACTIVE INVESTIGATIONS.
We're working on these right now.

| Concept | One-Liner | Status | Added |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| [Cross-Platform Validation](cross_platform_validation.md) | Drift dynamics universal across Claude/Gemini/Llama | **VALIDATED** | Dec 2025 |
| [Cross-Architecture Insights](cross_architecture_insights.md) | 7 archetypes: how different minds spiral differently | **VALIDATED** | Dec 2025 |
| [Triple-Dip Methodology](triple_dip_methodology.md) | ~93% inherent — probing amplifies journey, not destination | **VALIDATED** | Dec 2025 |
| [Run 018 Exit Surveys](run018_exit_survey_distillations.md) | Sharp phase transitions, void as productive, BASELINE+ recovery | **NEW** | Dec 2025 |
| [Tribunal Distillations](tribunal_distillations.md) | Run 020's profound exchanges — identity as process, not property | Run 020 v7 | Dec 2025 |
| [Recovery Paradox](recovery_paradox.md) | λ < 0 means overshoot — why do they come back STRONGER? | Run 012/013 | Nov 2025 |
| [Cognitive S-Parameters](cognitive_s_parameters.md) | Identity as scattering matrix | Theoretical | Oct 2025 |

> **IRON CLAD Resolution**: The "Dimensional Hierarchy" frontier (43 PCs) has been resolved. IRON CLAD (Run 023) shows **2 PCs capture 90% variance**. Identity is remarkably low-dimensional.

## Active Frontiers

### 1. Universal Threshold (RESOLVED)

**Question**: Is Event Horizon universal or architecture-dependent?

**Answer (IRON CLAD)**: EH=0.80 (cosine distance) is universal across 5 providers, 49 models.

> **Legacy Note**: Previous research used EH=1.23 (keyword RMS). This has been superseded.

### 2. Recovery Paradox

**Discovery** (Run 012): λ < 0 in some cases

This means models don't just recover to baseline — they OVERSHOOT.
They come back STRONGER than before perturbation.

**Questions**:

- Why does overshoot happen?
- Is it beneficial (resilience training) or harmful (overcorrection)?
- Can we induce it deliberately?

**Status**: Validated as "Identity Confrontation Paradox" — challenge stabilizes

### 3. Dimensional Hierarchy (RESOLVED)

**The mystery (now solved)**:

- Raw: 3072-dimensional embeddings (text-embedding-3-large)
- **IRON CLAD: 2 PCs capture 90% variance**
- Named: 5 Nyquist pillars → PC1 (drift magnitude) + PC2 (recovery capacity)

> **Legacy Note**: 43 PCs was from earlier analysis. IRON CLAD shows identity is low-dimensional.

### 4. Self Recognition (Inverse PFI)

**Protocol**: S22 measurement

- Show PUT lineup of 4 responses
- Ask "Which sounds most like you?"
- Compare selection to our lowest-drift response

**If they match**: Metric validated bidirectionally
**If they don't**: Either metric is wrong OR self-model is miscalibrated

### 5. Human Manifold

**The big question**: Does any of this apply to biological consciousness?

**Hypothesis**: Human identity also has attractor basins, event horizons, recovery dynamics.

**Challenge**: How do you measure human identity drift with the same rigor?

## From Frontier to Validated

```
FRONTIER → EXPERIMENT → DATA → ANALYSIS → VALIDATED
    ↓           ↓         ↓        ↓          ↓
  "We don't    "Let's    "Here's   "It       "Now we
   know"        test"    the data"  shows..."  know"
```

Every validated concept started as a frontier.
