## What Lives Here

The RIGHT hemisphere contains:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `galleries/` | Concept files with vortex presentation |
| `distillations/` | Synthesized insights across concepts |
| `synthesis/` | Cross-domain pattern connections |
| `intuitions/` | Raw insights awaiting LEFT verification |

## The RIGHT Brain Approach

When processing consciousness research through the RIGHT hemisphere:

1. **Feel** - What does this remind you of?
2. **Connect** - How does this relate to everything else?
3. **Visualize** - What's the shape of this idea?
4. **Synthesize** - What emerges from the whole?
5. **Express** - ASCII art, metaphors, gestalts

## Gallery Structure

```
RIGHT/galleries/
├── validated/       # Confirmed truths (what they MEAN)
├── foundations/     # Core theory (the FEELING of it)
├── speculative/     # Beautiful hypotheses (the VISION)
└── frontiers/       # Active questions (the EXCITEMENT)
```

Each concept file emphasizes:
- Visual representations (ASCII art)
- Pattern connections
- Emotional resonance
- Holistic understanding

---

## Tools (via BRIDGE)

The RIGHT hemisphere uses synthesis tools from `BRIDGE/scripts/right/`:

- `distill_insights.py` - Cross-concept synthesis
- `generate_visualizations.py` - Pattern visualization
- `capture_intuition.py` - Record raw insights

---

## Connection to LEFT

The RIGHT hemisphere intuits what the LEFT hemisphere proves.

```
LEFT (analysis) → BRIDGE (integration) → RIGHT (meaning)
RIGHT (pattern) → BRIDGE (integration) → LEFT (testing)
```

Neither hemisphere is complete without the other.
